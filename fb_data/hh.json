It's a angular style webapp (canjs). My colleagues and I plan to split up the css into the \"small, medium, and large\" categories. So, I have two questions.\n\nFirst:\nIs this the right approach to manage this amount of css. We were thinking about splitting it up each section of the site, but I think this would just lead to many components of our site looking inconsistent.\n\nAnd secondly:\nA lot of our css is inactive after we went through a large refactor, is there an easy way to isolate all the inactive css? Suppose I want to find all the css that isn't activated by any screen size, or css that's common across medium and large screens. Basically is there a way to do set operations (is this the right way to say this?) on css? \n\nThanks for your help fam.",

It's a text-based cooking party game for up to 4 players (local multiplayer on one keyboard), with a single-player mode as well.\n\nI'd love for everyone to try it out, and I hope it inspires any other hackers out there. React is one of my favorite frameworks and really great for quickly prototyping web/html5 games! Feel free to take a look at the source code, though some parts are a bit hacky (sorry!)\n\nGame link: http://www.toomanychefs.party/\nSource code: https://github.com/navignaw/TooManyChefs\nDevelopment blog: http://toomanychefs-game.tumblr.com/",

Maths is all about manipulating objects which follow some set of rules. As I explain in the proposal, this is pretty much one of the definitions of a game. Thus VR will improve the experience of maths for the exact same reasons it is improving the experience in games\n\nAlso, we will not just improve how we do maths\nwe will qualitatively change how we do maths\n\nI mean, computers have already made some parts of maths incredibly better, and these will of course keep improving with VR. These are things like geometry, and a few other visualization programs.\n\nHowever, these are kinda the obvious things for which you'd do maths in a game-like fashion.\n\nThe novel idea of AugMath is that the more algebraic part, the more formal part, the part of maths that seems to be more about the \"left brain\", and thus often more boring to people, can actually be as interesting, visually appealing, and awesome to explore, as the other parts\n\nPeople that play with cellular automata have already seen this, but this is a bit of an obscure part of maths, compared to algebra, calculus, etc. But all of these can also be upgraded with the helps of computers, and VR.\n\nThis is all about a shift from putting maths in a pedestal of abstraction where mathematicians find it so beautiful and elegant, but in reality they have lost all clarity that could make people understand, and going instead to the more pragmatic idea of concrete maths. Instead of some proffesor telling you x should do this and that, and you are supposed to fit all this in your head, and whatever. You see x, you poke it, and it does the right thing. It is maths that does what it should, from the beginning. It will also be maths that looks like what it means. 5 doesn't doesn't look like the number 5. IIIII, does. That is the power of good notation (in an extremelly simplified case here lol)\"\n\nMore detailed description: https://www.overleaf.com/read/vrghkvfndjzb\n\nEarly history: https://forum.fractalfuture.net/t/augmented-math-and-education/265",

Currently we are organizing 35 hackathons simultaniously during 25-29 May with 6 hackathons starting each 6 hours lasting 24h per hackathon. \n\nThis is of course a hectic period for me as an organizer especially because it is very hard to let you know all about the hackathons. Therefor I categorized them under http://nl.campus-party.org/challenges (check them out! All of them are global impact cases and we will supply hundreds of hackers with dev. Kits and thousands of IoT sensors and Arduinos to get you started)\n\nNext to that every hackathon has their own API's open which will result in an immense opportunity for developers to combine 10s of APIs to get to epic Innovative prototypes. Of course I am curious how to convince great hackers like you over to the event, is this enough excitement or what are things that really make you super interested and will even let you fly over :) \n\nWe currently have 200 Brazilians flying in 200 Spanish, 50 U.S.  and 100s from Germany, UK, Poland, Czech with a total of 2300 atm but we have space for 5000 tents so we are happy to give you an epic time here and a great way to come to Amsterdam for the first time perhaps ;)\n\nLet me know what you think, very curious if you have already heard from Campus Party.",

I feel it's important tool to have a grasp of this as it helps one understand their relative worth. \n\nI realize this is a subjective question which is why finding information about this online has been frustrating.  The data i've found is too often incomplete.  Either outdated, unspecific (base pay vs total comp?) or ambiguous in other ways.\n\nNaturally one of the reasons this is difficult to answer, is because this widely depends on where you work.  However, I would like you to narrow the scope of ambiguity in this case to what you would consider top tier companies. \n\nSo if you could please, let me know your input! How much do you / or your \"friends\" make?  Also explain your answer, for example which city are you referring to? How much is base vs equity?  \n\nAlso if you have input to make the question more intelligible, please do!",

Several friends asked me to help them do the same, so I made a Google form and posted it on Facebook allowing anyone to sign up to get a personally tailored list of scholarships. The response was overwhelming.\nAfter running initial tests with several happy customers, we got to work. Ben Shteinfeld, Cissy Yu, Jared Siskin and I built a website and a full backend system to manage the scholarship search and hired more freelancers.

I asked if I could email them a digital scan as an image or a .pdf and they said \"No, it must be faxed.\"\n\nUniversity of Virginia gets an award for having the worst website layout I've seen in years. You could get lost for days trying to find anything on their site (screenshot included). They accidentally said that my admissions decision was available a week before it actually was, and they assign random 8-character passwords that I have yet to find a way to change. (What am I going to do with \"!5Q#.D70\" ?)\n\nMultiple other colleges have emailed me passwords as plaintext (not my own passwords, thankfully, but still ones that I'm supposed to use for months and can't easily change.)\n\nA certain other college (name omitted because there's a slight possibility I may actually go there) does not include the \"View your decision\" link ANYWHERE on the applicant portal. If you want to see if you've been accepted or not, you have to request a password reset link, set a new password (I kid you not) and only then be redirected to a sub-page of the applicant portal that shows your decision. And if you want to double-check the acceptance/rejection letter again a few days later, you have to request and set a new password AGAIN.\n\nDo colleges realize that the admissions office is the main thing a student interacts with when applying to them? If a college's admissions office is incompetent at CS, I'm going to look at that school more critically, and it could potentially be enough to discourage me from applying or going there (I'd inevitably have to deal with plenty of other offices and departments at that college, and I'm not looking to pay for four years of frustration.)\n\nThoughts?

Does teaching keep you sharper with your algorithmic skills ? (I am feeling yes). \n2. How easy/hard it is to get back into industry from teaching ? (I am skeptical of this. It's always easy to go from industry to teaching. How hard the other way ? Will I be burning a bridge into industry by not going into industry ?)\n\nWould appreciate if people who have already taught coding/programming could give some opinions on this. \n\nContext: \nI have a couple of really good industry offers (including one from an Indian unicorn, one from a valley unicorn). But both places are not especially known for good work-life balance cultures. You know how it goes - hippie coders proud of their 12-14 hour work day, sprinting like Usain Bolt towards burnout. But the work scope at both the places is huge, cutting edge, evolving tech - working with Android OS modifications (something I have been doing via OSS contribs for last 4 years. \nI also have an offer to take up a teaching job at a highly successful and profitable code school. It'll also be like a first 1~5 employee level hire, where I'll be also responsible for near future expansion plans (There is huge demand, wait lists of 400-500 students, so there is great scope of expanding business). Teaching is something I like doing, and I have been running a Android/Open Source special interest group in college for the past 3 years, which is 2k strong now, and we have regular meet-and-learn sessions where mostly I teach stuff, and I have taken dozens of one-off workshops at colleges, GDG meetups, FOSS gatherings, DroidCon, PyCon etc.",

The end product is slow, not very responsive, hard to make things do the way I want it. \nAlso have been trying my hand at React and React Native, because there were some apps I made for people, and they wanted cross-platform, so was experimenting with ReactNative. \nThe problem I have always felt was that webapp frameworks are very weirdly designed - as if the authors wanted to create a specific solution for a specific problem, and then just open sources the code calling a 'framework'. And these frameworks try so hard to be 'apps' but just aren't. Functional programming and callback spaghetti never leaves you alone, although stuff like JSX tries so hard to be declarative instead of procedural. \nAnd that was when I came across Ember (really I liked the Ember sticker from StickerMule sample pack - and thought, let's try this one), and it has been a revelation. For someone who is accustomed to 2-file components in Android (a layout xml, and a activity/fragment class - for most patterns), I felt so at home with Ember. The way it is heavily opinionated also plays well with me, because mobile development SDKs like Android are also opinionated. The best part was it compiles into the final product, so I can mostly work on the UI in a very declarative manner - which to me is very essential. I always get confused when UI is not declarative. Writing funcitons to generate UI elements is so not my thing. \nAlso, why I'd say Ember stands out for me, is it does not force me to learn things like JSX (in React) or directives (Angular) - which are non-generic patterns, made with specific use cases in minds, and are not elemental building blocks of Javascript, and aren't portable concepts. \n\nAnd that is when I was wondering, why so much hype around Angular and React, when Ember is clearly a superior solution (personal opinion, I concede). And so I started browsing \nhttp://builtwithangular.com/\nhttps://www.madewithangular.com/#/ \nhttp://builtwithreact.com \nhttp://builtwithreact.io/\nhttp://builtwithember.com/ \nhttp://builtwithember.io \nand it was pleasantly surprising to find some of the websites I love the most for having clean interfaces and fast and responsive design are made in Ember like Crunchbase, Apple Music, Vine, Platstation Now, Twitch and Heroku. It assured me, that my belief was not all wrong.\n\nIf there are people like me - finding Angular or React/Flux too weirdly organised, you might want to take a look at Ember. The routing is beautifully done, and the plumbing and boilerplate generation all is handled by the ember-cli. It really is a very mature framework.",

However, SQL usage (both raw and with ORMs) with Node have significantly less documentation and community backing. Why do very few people (at least on tutorials, public projects) use Node.js with SQL or ORMs in comparison to those who uses NoSQL?\n\nAll I see for Node.js is the MEAN stack and various NoSQL set ups (bundled in things like meteor). It's very strange for me to see so little content and a very small community working on Node and SQL. Although ORMs have performance drawbacks, I also hear a lot of drawbacks of using non-relational databases (like startups failing, etc) as opposed to SQL's reliability and age, plus ORMs solve the Object-Impedence mismatch issue.\n\nI had to use SQL on a Node project and to cope with this, I used the most popular Node ORM Sequelize to map my JavaScript code to SQL queries so that I could focus on using one language, but the documentation and community is lacking and as a result it took a lot of time for me to discover how to use it in simple ways that would take me minutes on MongoDB.  \n\nDo you think sequelize or other ORMS are mature enough for production environments? Is there a lot of overhead with ORMs like Sequelize + Node?﻿",

Accelerators exist for hackers who want to turn their idea into a fundable startup, but what about the ones who just go to a hackathon to try out programming? Many beginners attend hackathons to get a taste of CS. While they're a good place to start, many are probably (disclaimer: don't have actual info on this, just presuming) lost on how to continue after the event, and end up back at square one.\n\nSo in addition to retaining rookie hackathon attendees, projects would also be maintained and improved upon. More coders, better software, greater long-term usefulness of hackathons -- win-win-win situation, right?\n\nThoughts on this idea?",

I have noticed a lot of the issues that he pointed out myself. HH, in recent months, has increased in size and scope dramatically within the last six months (to quote Frank's time frame in his original post). That is amazing and should be celebrated.\n\nWith that being said, the massive influx of new users has resulted in some issues. Thought provoking discussions and serious critiques of new products, services, and technologies are frequently drowned out by, frankly, shitposts and memes that can make even the best posts' threads feel like something out of one of the \"saner\" boards on 4Chan at best (at worst it's basically a tech equivalent of [insert major news organization here]'s Facebook comments section). And, while we do have HH subgroups, most of the outreach does tend to occur on this main group.\n\nSo what has happened here? From what I've seen from sitting on the sidelines, we have exploded in terms of the user base, popularity, and outreach capabilities of the group. This is excellent for us as a community. At the same time, though, I have also noticed that we are creating more and more subgroups to offload some of this extra traffic onto. While this is a good short term solution, we need to figure out a long term solution to sustain our rapidly growing size. I feel that the moderation issues that Frank identified are caused by a highly decentralized HH presence on Facebook, GitHub, and other relevant sites and services. More \"HH affiliated\" groups pop up every day, and it is hard to keep a handle on all of them while still attempting to manage a core group of 22,000+ members.\n\nIn other words, I believe we have outgrown Facebook Groups.\n\nBased on how the group feed is behaving in terms of how Facebook's code is handling the massive amounts of posts that occur in this group on a daily basis, I believe that Facebook cannot handle this sort of group effectively (especially when we are forking into subgroups every time we find another niche that users are interested in). Therefore, I propose that we move to a more traditional, older style message board format in order to better handle this large community we are all a part of. Although it won't be as trendy as being on Facebook, it would allow HH and its various interests to have a more direct overview of things while allowing the users to be better able to interact with their various subgroups without clogging the central feed. We would also have the benefit of solidifying our presence in one centralized site.\n\nWhat do you guys think of this idea? What are your opinions on the issues that HH is facing?",

We don't want to eliminate user input but 10,000 people joining the group and diluting content quality down to reddit/tumblr levels isn't democratic user input - a democratic society requires its population to be educated about its values and ideologies to have productive dialogues.

                    "message": "Hey everyone.\n\nI recently posted what I thought was a funny joke about using bash commands in OSX and calling it \"linux.\" Admittedly, I was doing it in a sense to protest, and I deserved what I got: almost immediately, people determined that they were right went about trying to tell me how wrong I was.\n\nQuickly, I was bombarded with insults -- up to, and including, calling my post \"gay\" -- an insult which I as a homosexual man have never understood -- can things that are not alive have sexualities? Even if they do, what's wrong with being fabulous? To me, being something being called \"gay\" seems like it should be a compliment in a community that prides itself on \"thinking differently.\"  \n\nAll of this talk over a single insult is besides the point, however. The question I'm asking of this group today is this: are we not better than this? \n\nThe hacker movement began many decades before most of us got involved. It was grounded in a community that saw itself as enabling human empowerment through personal technology. It was about freeing ourselves to be whatever we wanted to be. The nascent PC industry, with deep roots into the 60's counterculture movement, saw these tools as empowering human connection and human freedom.\n\nHave you ever stopped and thought about what TCP/IP as a protocol really means? It means you don't need centralization to communicate. It means you don't need anybody to tell you who you can and can't talk with. It means you can connect these devices and suddenly you can talk and work on projects with anyone around the world. And it means that there's nothing technically anyone can do to stop you. Unix, TCP/IP, the world wide web, etc -- these tools that we take for-granted were utopic - even communistic -- visions about giving power to communities. This group is an example of one kind of community that's enabled through this amazing technical medium. There's been a lot of corruption in the process, sure. Maybe corporatism is to blame for all of our problems. I don't know. What I do know is that each and every day each of us can try and be a just a bit better.\n\nHistorically, hackathons -- real hackathons, not corporate megahackathons -- are about bringing people together in that spirit of empowerment through community. But in a community, nobody attempts to appear as if they are better, smarter, or cooler than anyone else. Communities share, communities give, communities love. People in communities act together towards shared vision and values. They don't pat themselves on the chest, and they certainly don't insult one another.  \n\nAm I perfect at living out community ideals? No, I'm just as bad as the next guy. When someone \"likes\" one of my Facebook posts, I feel a short, euphoric, even addicting sense of excitement. I probably will feel that feeling for rush for everyone who \"likes\" and comments on this post. It's something I'm working on. It's probably why I talk a lot about myself. I am not perfect. But I'm trying. \n\nThis group is giant. It's bigger than any of our friends from computing's past could've ever imagined. But it's only as powerful as the love each of us brings to the table.\n\nAre we here to criticize others? Are we here to shitpost /r/programmerhumor for maximum likes and comments? Are we here to make our Medium posts go #viral? Or are we here to grow together? To build together? To love together?\n\nI think we're here for the latter reasons, and I think we can do better. \n\nThere are many wonderful people who have already resigned from believing that we can do better -- even calling this space \"cancer.\" Hell, Cirque du Twerque, an entire community of people upset at what HH has become has developed outside of it purely to ridicule it, and I'm admittedly a key part of that community. I think these people are actually signs that we can do better -- that we need to do better. \n\nSo I'm writing this post out of desperation -- to call on each one of you to bring your love to the table. To try and be just a bit better every day. To post things because they are interesting, not because they will make you popular. \n\nWe will never all agree. But we can disagree in ways which make us all better. We can engage in rational, loving debate -- debate that's about thinking about the kind of world we can be building, not how horrible we think the world is today. We don't need to yell at key members of our community over language on a piece of paper, and we don't need to insult our fellow human beings because we think we're smarter than them.\n\nThere are certain things, of course, the mod team -- if we wanted them to -- could do to make this a more loving space. Banning memes, for instance, which are rooted in virality and which are designed specifically to overshadow other dialogue -- would be a huge step in the right direction. \n\nBut we don't need them to take action. We could simply decide that we don't want memes in this group, and not post them. We could decide as a community that we want to come together in this virtual space to become better hackers and builders. \n\nAnd that's what I'm asking from this group one last time. Can we each decide that we want to love each other a little bit more? I think we can. \n\nAnd I think a good way to start that -- if you've made it this far -- is to comment on this post with someone who went out their way to help you (at a hackathon, through this group, or elsewhere) and how that changed your life.\n\n<3",

But now the developer just decided to quit because he had some \"more important business to attend\" and decided to leave with no previous notice.\n\nWe're really sad and disappointed in that person, so right now we're looking for a true teammate, a developer that can help us with the backend. We really do this to help others and to connect people, neither of us are taking a salary because there's nowhere to take it from. We hope we can get some sponsors this year to expand our reach and help more people but right now we're just donating our work. We've put a lot of hours and we'd really like to see this project come to life.\n\nIf you feel passionate about this project, want to be part of a close, international team and can help us build the backend, we'd love to have you!

Please share this with your friends and family!\n\nHey everyone, myself and the OutBully team has been working on OutBully for the past few months. Bullying is a commonly dismissed issue within educational institutions and society. However, over 160,000 students miss school everyday due to bullying. We want to make schools a safer place for people to learn and grow without fear. That is why we created OutBully. It is an anonymous reporting app that partners with faculty and the use of student ID to follow up on incident reports in real time. No longer should a child not feel welcome on their campus. And with real time reporting officials can receive anonymous witness statements to prevent further dismissal of this pressing issue. Join on our website linked below to become a participant in the move to end bullying.\n\nThank You!",

I asked and she told me calls,texts and data are all the same in Canada. So free calls and texting and data at the same rate. I'm like awesome. Then I told her about a small bug I had where data wouldn't turn off always when I turned off cellular and she said it was known and there'll be a bug fix soon.  She said just in case it does effect me she'll put a 10$ credit on my account (that's a GB worth of data) and I'm like...

Launched in 2014 by US Secretary of State John Kerry at the Our Ocean conference, Fishackathon 2016 will be held in over 40 cities around the world.\n\nhttp://fishackathon.hackitarians.com/ \n\nFishackathon is a wonderful example of how we can use technology to address some of the world’s most challenging issues. As an animal lover, ocean enthusiast, member of the OceanElders and supporter of Ocean Unite, I’m passionate about protecting the ocean and its species, and am looking forward to seeing what wonderful innovations the Fishackathon spurs. I encourage all coders and fish fans, or anyone else who’s interested, to participate in this event, says Richard Branson, founder of Virgin.com.\n\nThe event is free to attend, all food and drinks will be supplied, and Fishackers are welcome to work late into the evenings and grab sleep at the venue.\n\nAfter working hard on the weekend the groups will be able to present their work to an expert panel of judges who will then evaluate the teams’ presentations and groups that most effectively develop usable solutions to the problem of global overfishing and will be rewarded with prizes including €10,000 cash and €25,000 in development support. Besides the cash prizes, organisers will throw in some local ‘money can’t buy’ prizes.\n\nOrganisers are looking for (game/UI/UX) designers, (game/app/full-stack) developers, coders, computer/data scientists, subject matter experts (Oceanography, Fish Science) and others who believe they have the skills to tackle this challenge of worldwide overfishing. Potential sponsors are welcome to contact the Hackitarians if they are interested in getting involved.\n\nPlease apply for the Fishackathon here for your chance to make a difference and win!\n\nhttp://fishackathon.hackitarians.com/\n\nThe event is supported by, U.S. Department of State, U.S. Embassy The Hague, European Space Agency (ESA), Liquid Robotics, Dutch Game Garden, Dutch Games Association, Wageningen University and organised by Dutch Hackathon Foundation, Stichting Hackitarians.\n\nAttendees should bring bedding (pillow, blanket) if they want to spend the nights at the venue. Or can take ferry back to the mainland in the evenings and return in the mornings to stay on mainland hotel or return home if they so choose (not covered by organisers).\n\nFort Island IJmuiden is a semi-underground fortress that is situated at the estuary of the North Sea Canal. The Fort Island was created around 1885 as an important advanced defence post for the gateway to Amsterdam. Some of its most interesting features include an impressive dining hall, a dungeon and an armoury. In 2012, the attraction was awarded the Golden Green Key, becoming the first UNESCO World Heritage location to obtain a golden environmental label.\nThe island is well served by deploying two vessels,  the ‘Fortwachter’ and the ‘Koningin Emma’.. The crossing to the island is a flight of about 10 minutes.",

I'm wondering if anyone here has GPGPU programming experience and is willing to share some tips and tricks. \n\nI'm studying physics, math, and CS right now, and I'll be the head of a project in our atomic physics lab that is essentially concerned with building an AI framework for automating all of the lasers and other fancy lab hardware. I'm  more or less up to date on the machine learning and whatnot that I'll need for the adaptive modules and I have some help from my math department associates for the computer vision components, but we have a major challenge in that all of our fancy AI code needs to run *fast* on a pitifully small workstation hardware budget. \n\nI'll be building the system that all of this is running on, and the current plan is to max our single precision FLOPS and memory bandwith, then see how far we can get with running most of our math on the GPUs. This gets us to territory that's unfamiliar to me, at least for the most part. I'll be studying up on the available APIs (we'll probably be using AMD hardware because you can't beat their price per FLOP and their last gen cards still have respectable memory bandwith) but I figured I might as well ask around and see if anyone can point me in a productive direction right off the bat. \n\nI'm super stoked about this project and we have tons of time to get everything done, so this is more of a \"looking for friendly advice\" request than a \"holy balls my deadline was yesterday pls halp\" post. Thanks in advance for any comments (and feel free to ask about the project if I've somehow intrigued you) n.n",

Takes forever to load and start playing music, also how come I can't see songs by artist when I've downloaded the songs to my device?? I don't care to go to the artist page, I just want to see the songs downloaded by-artist. Or I might have a playlist downloaded locally but when I select it, the UI never loads. I can double-click the playlist and the music starts playing but the only way I can jump around is pressing next/back - the list never actually displays.\n\nOnline I don't have many complaints, but if I'm in a low-bandwidth area or just want to avoid accidentally using cellular, the offline modes are terrible. Am I the only one having these problems?....",

We learned next to 0 programming in class, but spent a lot of time learning about autism. \n\nI applaud these guys for their work. It's really cool, truly. But I think this is a cool instance of being able to point out how important it is to think of how your creation is actually gonig to be used, how it fits into your user's life, and, very importantly, why you need someone on your team with very in depth knowledge of the problem you are trying to solve / industry you are tackling. \n\nIn the end, this is a good example of cool engineering from talented people, with a disconnect between them and the purpose of their product.",

So I'm asking for advice on the proper attire for meeting company's for internships and jobs and also where I can get then where I won't break my bank. I basically seen all kinds of suits, some with and without the jacket, some with vest etc. I just overall need some advice. Thanks guys.\n\nEDIT: CS major",

Some advanced people will help, but the idea is that people shouldn't rely on them, they should learn to learn instead. The main languages (I am in a psychology department) will be python and MATLAB and I have about 50 people that registered (free) since yesterday. \n\nWhat would be your favorite python starter kits, fun tutorials/projects and learning websites?

So I have created a custom object in JavaScript and included the custom object type in my background scripts for the extension. I am running into issues once an object with the type of group (my custom object) is saved into storage. Chrome.storage.sync.set serializes objects of type object down to {} which is object literals so when I am pulling that object out of storage later, the methods that I added to the prototype are throwing errors that the methods don't exist. I tried moving the methods inside the functions in an object literal format and it didn't seem to make a difference. Can anyone help!? If you want to look at the code click the link below, the error is thrown on line 69 after using the popup to add a url. After clicking the button it is receiving the message, and then tries to check whether the group contains the url and that is where the isssues begin! Thanks in advance guys",

You'll come out of the event feeling like a kid again while being inspired and equipped to take on whatever comes your way.\n\nIf you're interested in going, you can use promo code \"sagnew20\" to get 20% off of your ticket :)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TeamTwilio/videos/vb.39535177758/10153459432127759/",

Instead AlphaGo uses less in-depth search techniques to only search ~20 nodes down into the search tree. Every move introduces 200-300 new possible efficient moves, and the total number of possibilities for board layout is 10^170.",

I'm looking for PERSONAL examples of when YOU said or did something that you think was censored unjustly because of college culture and such. Not something you THINK would've been censored but in fact were censored. I'm trying to see the extent of this movement if there is any. I want this to see if the new Hackathon rules are actually censoring anything worthwhile ( I don't think so FYI , but I want other perspectives).\nThanks\n\nEDIT: Also thank you for not deleting this post , it reflects well on the so called \"Safe space\" epidemic that questioning of if the policies have actually chilled any speech or not , and if that speech is worthwhile, does not get censored :)\nAgain, I'm not against the code of conduct just wondering if there was actually any worthwhile thoughts or positions chilled by the policy.",

Apparently and thankfully, my post provoked a lot of thought.  I wasn't able to see anyone's feedback after the first handful of comments (my phone was out of power).  If anyone read this and had constructive feedback to provide about the content within it, I would greatly appreciate your feedback below.  Also- I decided that I will 100% not be posting here again until Day37, this Sunday, when I'll write my response to HH as part of Mon Baroi's challenge (which was an amazing idea).  After that, I won't post these here again until #Day60 at earliest.  Thank you everyone for your feedback; it is really helpful to me during this quest to make it as a technology-focused writer.",

Obviously this is all just a bunch of information floating around, but I was hoping if anyone here had some insight that could help me get a clearer understanding of the schools, then I'd really really appreciate it. \nThank you!",

I have a Github, yes. I have a personal website displaying my projects, yes. I spent time writing responses to each and every question each and every one of the applications, yes. But the answer I got from 16 of the 17 hackathons? No. The other one, I'm still anxiously waiting for a response. Regardless of my appeals and my requests to go to hackathons during this formative part of my life, I was denied or indefinitely waitlisted from EVERY single one I applied to. The only hackathon I got to attend this year was one where I had to pay for a ticket to be allowed to go. \n\nAs part of this group, I've seen countless individuals receive acceptances to a large amount of hackathons. I am just writing this to ask one simple question:\nWhere did I go wrong?\n\nWas my website bad? Was my github not impressive enough? Were my applications not worthy enough? Did I have an incredible amount of bad luck to get denied to 16/16 hackathons I applied to with released decisions? \n\nI honestly have no response for this and I was hoping someone might. I know this probably means very little to the community as a whole, but I'm writing this for the few others out there who, like me, have been rejected from countless hackathons for issues beyond our control. If my portfolio is unimpressive, maybe that's the reason I applied to the hackathon in the first place! Maybe I want to learn web development to improve my website. This group is often talking about how hackathons are supposed to help bring more people into computer science but how does that happen if some people get into every hackathon and others can't even get into one? I do not speak for myself alone. I am speaking on behalf of at least 5 others I have spoken to who are faced with similar (though not nearly as drastic as 16 rejections) as I am. \n\nIf anything, I hope this can spark a discussion in the community. \nThank you for reading this.",

I did the opposite, starting with C++ and then moving to Java and in about a million different directions afterwards, picking up a few languages pretty quickly. I think that going from C++ as a starting point was super beneficial for me, not least because many other languages have their syntax, etc. derived from it, but also because it required *so* much legwork that a lot of other languages abstract away -- understanding what was going on behind the scenes when I use Python, for example, or even Java (what with the garbage collection and memory management) has made me a better programmer. I'm trying to petition my university to drop Python and JS as the entry level languages (most people don't see Java until sophomore year) and something a little lower-level. I have found through helping some of my classmates that a lot of their issues and bugs come from not handling correctly the things that the high-level languages abstracted away.

It's a programming competition that will last over 8 days. \n\nThe aim will be to program an autonomous bot and send it fight into an arena against other players' bots. \n\n25 programming languages are available to code a solution, and it takes less than 10 minutes to come up with a basic AI.\n\nWe're pretty much excited about the game (hint: Puyo Puyo). We've tried to make it both fun and beautiful in terms of animations.\n\nHere's the link to register: https://goo.gl/XKgK3Z\n\nSignup is free for everyone and there will be cool prizes to win (HTC Vive Headset, Myo armband, Geekbox).\n\nIf you want to practice a little bit and check what the environment looks like, we advise you to start with 2 solo puzzles:\n- \"Surface\": https://goo.gl/7dZOyt\n- \"Gravity\": https://goo.gl/VqTgEU\n\nThanks for checking!",

So there is an opt-out mechanism, and it'll hopefully be expanded in the future.

Or resume books. I just didn't like how I got an e-mail telling me *I* applied to Monsanto and that I only found it was through HackIllinois because I misspelled my name (in a very specific way) on the application.\n\n=================\n\nLooks like HackIllinois just sold our resumes to Monsanto. Weird part is that I didn't even get in.\n\nThoughts on having your resume sold to a company by a hackathon you didn't even get accepted to? Is that a practice you agree with?

The hackathon I'm at has no sleeping rooms because of fire codes, so I don't blame them for it. Still, when I asked about it, they suggested I hang out wherever I can find (which seems like it would also break fire codes since I'd end up blocking a hallway) or go try sleeping in a room where people were hacking anyway (????).\n\nSeriously, sleep is completely necessary for healthy hacking but it seems like if I go to a hackathon, there's a 50/50 chance that any sleep accommodations exist. It seems ridiculous because organizers and group members here talk about wanting to break the culture of depriving yourself of sleep for 24-36 hours, and yet it seems like no progress is being made on this front. It seems like I have to wait for everyone else to tire themselves out at ridiculously late hours for me to get sleep myself, and the sleep I do get certainly won't be a healthy amount.\n\nFrankly, the one thing that I'd like to see come out of this, at the very least, is that MLH should make some sort of accommodations mandatory for their hackathons and assist organizers in providing them, whether they be:\n- Designated sleeping rooms\n- Quiet areas or quiet hours\n- Earplugs and a dark room if it really comes down to it\n- Literally anything to show an effort was made",

Last fall it attracted over 60 people but this year we’re looking to double that number because we’ve received backing from Hackester.io, Microchip and Intel. The main purpose of this event is to introduce makers and hackers to the entrepreneurial community and provide avenues for creating startups through interdisciplinary collaboration. We are connecting the teams formed in the event with mentors and other entrepreneurship communities like #yesphx (Startup Week) which will help guide their project to the next level.\nSome details about the event:\n \nDate & Time:   4:30p April 22nd – 6:30p 24th\nLocation:          Startup Labs, ASU Polytechnic campus",

                    "message": "Hey guys. I wanted to bring something up to your attention. I was emailed by someone claiming to be a recruiter who had seen my website and decided to send me an in depth critique of it, and then tried to blackmail me into working for him. He said if i did not email him, he would tell my boss and the rest of team. He is very knowledgable about me. I feel like this is a friend who is trolling me, or someone from this group, but i can't be sure.\n\nI have decided to take his comments and fix my website and resume over the weekend. He's not wrong on some of the points. Also, my boss already knows. He laughed.\nI assume many of you will continue on with what he started and that's cool. One can never be weary of criticism.\n\nHe doesn't sound like a recruiter, and with that kind of attitude, why would I want to work for him?\nHas anyone else seen anything like this?\n\n-----------------------------------------\nWithout futher ado, the original email:\n\nHello Hamza Khan,\n\nI wanted to reach out to you about an opportunity at Sharklasers. We are looking for front-end developers that know jQuery and AngularJS. Our company is willing to sponsor individuals that sign a minimum 2 year employment contract with our company.\n\nI came across your personal website in this repo: https://github.com/HackathonHackers/personal-sites. I took a good look into your personal website's code, your Github profile, your repositories, repositories you have contributed to, and your resume, the companies you have worked for.\n\n---\n\nPLEASE READ ALL OF THE FOLLOWING AND THE NUMBERED POINTS BELOW: The details of our offer are at the bottom of this email. However, I would like you to know that your website is utter shit. I highly suggest you show this to your boss, or I will. When the company you work for only has 8 people on LinkedIn, it's easy to let your company know you're shit. But sometimes we like to hire shit and make those people gold.\n\n#1 it's a ripoff of a website by UHCodeRED [UHCodeRED/CodeRED-Fall-2015] on Github. I tool a look at your page's source files to see if you actually know your shit, and all I had to do is search up some of the JS and found that it was the exact same code as that repo. After further inspecting your code it looks like you completely copied their code.\n\n#2 \"The Programmer You Never Knew You Needed\". What a fucking ignorant thing to say. Why the fuck would anyone want to employ you with that kind of an asshole attitude.\n\n#3 \"As you may have guessed, my name is Hamza Khan\". No shit.\n\n#4 \"I am a Computer Science student interested in technology.\" You're not a student according to your shitty resume.\n\n#5 \"... the mind blowing Oculus Rift.\" The Oculus Rift isn't mind blowing. Every developer knows it's a joke how easy it is.\n\n#6 \"My Drive\" Why the fuck is Drive red?\n\n#7 \"... drumming out a quality program\". Drumming? This isn't band, and the quality of your programs is shit.\n\n#8 \"That is my drive.\" Why is drive fucking red again? It looks like a damn hyperlink.\n\n#9 \"READY. SET. CODE!\" Oh my fucking god shoot me now. Why the fuck is this even here.\n\n#10 The fucking shadows in your text are FUGLY AS FUCK. I'm not designer, but wtf is this? 2003?\n\n#11 CodeRed -> CodeRED\n\n#12 \"Made in Unity\" why is Unity hyperlinked. People fucking know what it is or know how to use a search engine.\n\n#13 \"Oculus Rift Virtual Reality headset and the LeapMotion Hand Controller.\" Again, wtf is up with those hyperlinks.\n\n#14 \"... shoot at each other aiming to defeat the other\". Oh I though they were shooting each other to show affection.\n\n#15 \"A Geofence is a point on a map with a circle around it.\" No, that's not what a Geofence is.\n\n#16 \"o Find locations near a user, that they never knew existed\nGitHub\" Why the fuck is this a lowercase \"o\"? Ever heard of a list? Why the fuck would I hire a developer if they don't know how to use basic HTML.\n\n#17 \"For my part, I will be integrating the Oculus Rift and the LeapMotion devices for gameplay.\" You will? So that means you didn't do it? Also, if you really meant that you DID, you basically did fucking nothing for the project. Both are easy as fuck to implement, a highschooler could do it. Took a look at the commits as well. You did nothing.\n\n#18 \"We have devised a complex method of gameplay where the Oculus will only control the direction a player looks in\" What bullshit. People in the tech industry aren't stupid. We know it's easy.\n\n#19 \"So far, the game is up and running.\" This is literally the most impressive thing I've read on the site so far.\n\n#20 \"Currently working on adding Leap gestural support.\" Nevermind. It wasn't impressive at all.\n\n#21 \"Unfortunately, for unknown reason Microsoft Azure will not deploy the project. Currently only works on localhost.\" Why the fuck would you tell people that.\n\n#22 You did 0% of the actual work for the Political Bias Predictor. I took a look at the commits.\n\n#23 Oh and for Hence, you did nothing as well. Github doesn't lie.\n\n#24 \"contact@hamzakhan.org\" what a shitty email address. I wonder if it even works.\n\n#25 \"hamzakhan.org\" wtf is up with your domain. Why the fuck is it .org? You're not a fucking organization.\n\n#26 I had to literally search your site for a resume. Why is it in the fucking contact section?\n\n#27 \"Bilingual\" What languages? I want to know. I give no fucks that you're bilingual unless the languages you speak are useful.\n\n#28 \"Computer Science graduate seeks entry level position\". Bad grammar, and holy fuck you scream \"I'm a noob who wants to do nothing\"\n\n#29 \"UHD – Houston, TX\" UHD? 4K? Was your education just watching a fucking TV? I had to look it up to actually know what university it was.\n\n#30 \"Hamz5678@hotmail.com\" this is a different email than the one you have on your site. What email am I supposed to reach you at?\n\n#31 \"Created content specific pages for website\" How vague. You probably did nothing.\n\n#32 \"Redesigned aspects of the website\" see #31\n\n#31 \"Revamped entire website\" Oh you did? How? Using what? The entire site? See #31.\n\n#32 \"Created modules to increase customer sales and retention\" wtf is a \"module\"? What modules? How did they increase sales and retention? By what percent did they increase? 0.0001% is technically an increase.\n\n#33 \"Web Developer\" a.k.a. I have a high-school freshman level IQ and I know HTML, CSS, jQuery, and how to install Wordpress plugins!\n\n#34 \"C++, C#, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java\" Let's be real, you probably don't KNOW C++, C#, MySQL, and JavaScript. I see no good examples of knowing them in your Github repo. If you interviewed with our company (or any company), we'd test the shit out of you to see if you're lying or not.\n\n#35 \"Web Frameworks: AngularJS, Bootstrap, jQuery,\" jQuery isn't a fucking framework. It's a library. Know the fucking difference. Also, why is there a comma at the end? Proofread your fucking resume.\n\n#36 The design of your resume is so terrible it makes me vomit in my mouth a little. Just make a fucking traditional resume or use a template.\n\n#37 Oh and the design and content of your personal website actually made me vomit. If you can't fucking design, then don't. I'd rather read plain text than the shit you've created (from stolen work).\n\n#38 \"lazy784@gmail.com\" is the email on your Github. Thanks for letting the world know you're lazy.\n\n#39 I took a look at the SSL.com Org you have listed on your Github profile. LOL you've literally done nothing.\n\n#40 I could go into your code on Github and tell you how shit it is, but I would rather not. It would be a complete waste of my time.\n\nPeople like you are the reason Houston has such a shit developer community. My company keeps looking for people in Houston and we just get depressed as fuck. That's why we mainly hire from Austin, the Valley, and New York. If I had to hire you for real, you'd get paid $2.40 an hour compared to my normal engineer's salary of $45 an hour. There's factory workers in China that are underage and starving that make more than you.\n\nI looked up up on Facebook as well. In case you didn't know, there's a fuck ton of recruiters and company owners in Hackathon Hackers and its subgroups. We see the shit you guys post, and we keep two lists of names. Those worth hiring and those we avoid at all costs. I'll let you guess which list you're on.\n\nAll it took was enough searching on Facebook to find the posts you've made, and wow you shit-post a lot. Oh and hey! You shit post during business hours as well! I bet your boss loves that! Oh and look, you tried to actually help your company! Wow 50% off SSL Certificates! Except when I read the comment, you can't answer basic questions and you can't argue a point. One of your co-workers had to step in and actually explain the BASICS.\n\n---\n\nLike I said we are giving you an offer. It is after this last wall of text.\n\nI hope you enjoyed my feedback, I expect a response within 4 hours. I will send this exact email to your boss whenever within those 4 hours. You can stop me if you reply quickly enough and don't piss me off.\n\nIf you do not respond within 4 hours, I will send this email (possibly with more on it) to your support team and the other members of your company that I have found via LinkedIn. No company deserves paying shit for shit work. Go work for McDonalds if you want to be lazy. I hear Walmart even pays $12-14 an hour now!\n\nSo, I'm willing to give you an offer. You'll make minimum wage, and we'll provide free food and housing for two years. We'll put you through a bootcamp (probably MakerSquare in Austin) for free, and we'll fly you out to our HQ in Dallas, TX. If you do well, you'll make up to $40K your first year, with opportunities to make up to $90K afterwards.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you hopefully within 4 hours,\n\nJacob Worstell\nSenior Architecture Engineer II - sharklasers.com",

We are focusing on finding workout partners for all fitness activities, to promote a healthy lifestyle. The app is very simple to use and doesnt require my company to set up an existing gym network. With enough growth, it'll work anywhere.

In less than 15 seconds the bot will reply to you. Use keywords like so \"@millertestbot dank\" to get different responses.

                    "message": "Hey guys, I need your help.\nI have a late 2008 MacBook Unibody (the first unibody that came out - ancient, I know, but still doing its job) and have a triple boot with OS X El Capitan, Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 10 (not fully supported but that's OK for me), accessing the systems via refind bootloader, as Apple's boot camp doesn't support Ubuntu. OS X was running first obviously, then came Ubuntu around a year ago, and Windows got in just a few months back. Everything was quite fine until a few weeks ago when I thought it might be not the worst idea to apt-get update & upgrade Ubuntu, since it wanted me to update every time it started. Since then my refind boot menu doesn't show my Windows system anymore. It still recognizes the Windows NTFS partition but boots into Ubuntu when I select it. \nI installed Windows by creating a boot DVD and replacing my second HDD with the super drive my MacBook came with, but after that I changed back to the second HDD for obvious reasons. So now my question: what actually might be broken? How can I fix the issue? And is there a way to repair my Windows boot partition without reinstalling Win10 completely? As this particular setup is rather rare I didn't find a valuable solution online yet.\nThanks in advance for your thoughts/help/solutions! \nGreets from Germany 🖖",

I used to hate math.  Despised it.  Left Calculus III with a C+ resolved never to touch it again.  But after trying my own take on how to interact with it, now I love math.  I may even minor in it. Without those motivational kind words for the CSS library from this group and HH Math, I can attest this project wouldn't exist.

As such, it's just really a matter of deciding what I should learn now - but both of these topics, while pretty far off from each other, are very very interesting to me, and it's hard to decide!\n\nSo, what do you all think I should learn first?

I purchased a domain several months ago (think November 2015), and like a week ago they sent me an email informing me my credit card issued a chargeback request on it, and to regain access to my account I'll have to pay $200 (later lowered to $100) as a \"chargeback fee\". \n\nI've been a very loyal Namecheap customer, and I've never had issues with them before. I'll talk to my credit card about it, but I really don't want to have to pay a fee for something that was completely out of my control. Any ideas/similar stories?",

Interested in some feedback/critique of our newly released Android app and first app made by Hexology, \"hexapp: Unlock & discover worlds of digital information all around you.\"\n\nIn particular would like to discuss in-app on-boarding.\n\nIs what we've done great, good, ok, bad or ugly? And why? What works and doesn't work?\n\nWhat are the best ways to on-board users into an app that's introducing some quite novel concepts?\n\nWe considered 3 approaches:\n\n1. TOUR. Have some sort of \"tour\" at the start that describes the main concepts\n2. HINTS. Provide hints / tooltips to guide the user through the app in-context as they use it, starting with the most basic thing they should do, and progressively disclosing\n3. NOTHING. Just make it as simple and obvious as possible what to do and people can discover how it works.\n\nWe've been through a few iterations of our on-boarding experience and we're still struggling with users \"getting it\". Striving for (3) and felt the need to do some (1).\n\nhexapp allows anyone to read and write messages and media into objects or places in the real-world, identified by QR code, barcode, NFC tag or GPS location.\n\nI'm very interested in:\na. Are the first few intro screens in the app an effective way of introducing the main concepts of the app?\nb. Is it clear what to do once you get through those intro screens?\nc. How do the on-boarding screens make you feel about the app?\n\nOpen to and ready for constructive criticism and this is newly open to the public so if you find any bugs would love to know!\n\nThanks!",

There's no enforcement policy for wrongdoing, there's no guarantees, absolutely nothing regarding preservation of hacker principles etc. I'd love to see the MLH Articles myself to determine whether or not this is the case, but I bet Swift (acting as a representative of MLH- nothing personal!) has some canned excuse as to why that can't be done. Google isn't being very kind either, and to obtain a copy myself costs $5 and must be done through the mail. (http://www.dos.ny.gov/corps/faq_copies.page.asp)\n\nI'm still wholly unconvinced that there's no self-interest at play within MLH, and that's why I'm concerned about conflict of interests between MLH and HH. MLH undoubtedly has the end goal of seeking profit, and a profit motive creates funny incentive schema that often work against customers (the hacking public.)\n\n",

You will no longer need to build your own backend, and it's fully documented. You could technically build your own version of Netflix, Facebook, or Twitter with it. It even has support for things like notifications, it has a full CI testing, and has been used in production in our products.\n\nYou can get it at https://github.com/Whitespell/whitespell-api (Please leave a star if you like what we've built).\n\nHere's what we built with it:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwsMM5hElkXESW0xMHFvMG9Ic1U/view\n\nDocumentation: http://whitespell.github.io/slate/\n\nIf you love something, set it free! Here is to open source technology and giving back. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/4esnln/we_at_whitespell_just_open_sourced_our_video/\n\nAll the best,\nPim de Witte",

What is the proper way to market an app? \n2. Best way to engage customers?(Twitter, fb, etc)\n3. How much of your day would you spend engaging customers?\n4. Would it make sense to pay for Twitter/fb ads if the app is free or $0.99?\n5. How do you get an app onto major websites like Product Hunt, Tech Crunch, etc?\n6. Other than an app, what else is needed to really give an app the best chance of succeeding? (Website, social media pages, email handle, etc) \n\nLet me explain where I'm at. I've developed many apps for both personal and freelance, but that's where my skill set ends when it comes to apps. There has always been another person to do marketing, so I want to know what it takes to become the whole package. \n\nOf course it would be dumb for me to ask these questions without having an app…so I developed Hole Keeper, a small app to keep track of score for games like corn hole, washers, etc. Whatever advice I get from this post I'm going to apply it to Hole Keeper. I'm not looking at it as a $1 million app, but as an app I can use to help improve my marketing skills. \n\nWhat has been completed:\n1. Developed and submitted to App Store(Pending Developer Release)\n2. Created website with fully functional beta tester form.(http://www.holekeeper.com/)\n3. Twitter account \n\nWhat else needs to be on the “Completed list” before releasing? Whatever advice you can give would greatly be appreciated. \n\nThanks!",

When I was working on the backend, I didn't care about sanitizing user input, exceptions handling, and all the security stuff (but I would take my time and learn how to do them properly if I am working on a personal website). And I know that some parts of my code simply won't run on other systems (say, forking in Windows). When you think about it, these are the things don't matter in the 2 minute demos, but are the tiny details that distinguish an experienced coder from a noob. And if your project gets to a top position, to the point that your code needs to be reviewed, the judges will probably only check for file creation dates and make sure you are not a hoax, but I don't think they plan on disqualifying teams based on their code quality or system design. \n\nWhile I admire and love the feeling of working non-stop (don't encourage, though), I am not sure if trying to GTD as long as it works and coming back later to see if you can make it better (more often you simply don't come back) is good for a student coder long-term. Creating an usable app is great, especially for good causes, but when you look back some time later you certainly want the quality causes to be powered by quality code.\n\n*edit: grammar *2",

I´m not sure if you remember me but I´m the Central American founder who got invited to the MIT Global Entrepreneurship Bootcamp (btw applications are now open for august!) and started a Go Fund Me campaign, but sadly couldn´t raise the funds. (I did raise 450 Dollars that are going to keep my project going)\n\nBut, what is my project? My best friend and I are creating a geolocation mobile application that enables its users to find spaces (bars, restaurants, hostels, etc.) near them based on their taste in music, how much money they can spend, the mood they are looking for (date or drinking your pants off or talk with friends) and the distance.\n\nBasically it is the love child of a three sum among Tinder, Yelp and Airbnb with my own Central American touch in the mix. We name this child @Vynil\n\nIt is meant for all of us that visit a new city and don´t know where to go in real time. Of course we can research but after an event everybody wants to go for drinks and you end up in the nearest pub or whatever...there is more fun out there.\n\nRight now we applied to Start-Up Chile with our idea and the most BASIC MVP ever, we are relaunching in May with this site http://govynil.com/ and our Android/IOS App.\n\nNow the question,\n\nI would love that you guys destroy my idea, give me mercyless feedback and if you like the idea add yourself to this group in which Im doing a collage of all the places around the world that buddies of mine and likeminded entrepreneurs hang out.\n\nI want to stick together to create a collaborative ad for Vynil, proper credits will be given to everyone and you will get to see cool places from around the world! Here is a video example\n\nThanks in advance everyone!",

I know all of these language are very powerful and have far greater abilities but I want to know how they are used to do backend development.

I think it's just about ready for more people to start trying it out, so I’m excited to invite all of you to start trying it out!\n\nhttp://facebook.com/twozeroo18\n\nMessage it with “@2018 help” for a somewhat detailed guide on what it can do, and how to use the bot.\n\nIt can do things like:\n- changing the chat color to any hex color\n- changing the chat emoji to any unicode emoji!\n- looking things up for when you're too lazy to google\n- having a conversation with when you're lonely with no friends\n- ... and more!\n\nPlease note that this is like an alpha version, and that many things aren’t working as expected.  It’s currently not based on the new APIs — it’s using a much more “hacky” solution that essentially involves simulating logging into messenger.com and sending messages as a person — so it won’t work perfectly.  (sometimes, it'll miss a message -- just resend it and it should work fine!)\n\nOver the next couple of months, I’ll continue releasing updates with more features (including /giphy — slack users rejoice) please feel free to keep using the bot!  It can hopefully do a lot for you.  The more you use it, the more it’ll learn about human interaction — the AI learns from conversations, so the more people chat with it, the smarter it becomes!\n\nand of course, if you see any bugs or have any questions/comments/concerns, please message me and lmk so I can fix it :)\n\nthanks, and I hope this experiment turns out amazing <3",

Every new club/chapter/organization that wants to start must attend an orientation, which for this semester was 1/25 and 1/28. As you all may notice, that is not a lot of possible opportunities to meet and it is soon after the semester starts.\n\nI bring up the orientation because it is necessary to start something on campus for the semester (returning clubs only have to fill out paperwork). The problem here is that I realized I wanted to create a local chapter of Upsilon Pi Epsilon (“International Honor Society for the Computing and Information Disciplines”) only on Wednesday,  2/10, after the orientations had happened. I’d like to start an UPE chapter because it is a relevant honors society and also as a way to organize and compete in the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC).\n\nWhen I asked a lady at the front desk of the Student Life Offices if I could start an UPE chapter, she said, like I have already, to start any new club/chapter, one must attend an orientation and that if I still wanted to start one, I would have to wait till the summer or fall. On top of that, what was so frustrating to hear is that “It’s just the way we do things [around here]”. The logic of this school bureaucracy makes no sense and I do not feel like waiting a whole semester to start something I am passionate about (coding and tech); I have already waited the whole previous semester because I mistakenly accepted the orientation reason then when trying to start a different, but also coding related, club. \n\nThe question now is how do I approach and resolve this problem? Should I try to find a higher level staff/admin involved in Student Life that might be understanding of my situation and talk it out with them? Ask the CS department chair and/or UPE organizers to add weight to the situation and hopefully improve it? \n\nAny and all suggestions would be helpful. Thank you all for your time :)",

It uses the Clarif(ai) API and extracts features from a user's facebook images, enabling search (and several other analytics and visualizations not included in this demo) on the user's images. This provides a search feature very similar to Google Photos, but we also have access to the image tags generated in this case and leverage the data to provide a unique gallery browsing experience to users - with maps, tag clouds, search and other analytics.\n\nStack - Flask, Elastic Search, Clarifai API, Esri API, and D3.js\n\nPlease click on the link and UPVOTE this idea!

One word: BULLSHIT. \n\nMicrosoft, you've been perpetuating this Boys-only (bordering on \"dirty old man\") environment for a long time, and promoting the very people that cause you \"embarrassment\". How many Partners/CVPs have had sexual harassment lawsuits settled for them by the company? That's a number I'd like to see; I can think of several without effort. You've had years of feedback from women (and men!), employees who were trying to make this a better place to be, and by extension a better company. To what end? Consequences and repercussions for the employees, promos for the offenders. So I say: fuck you, you finally got caught. \n\nYou behave like an abusive, disrespectful, porn-addicted boyfriend; this is why women keep leaving you. \n\nPS: to the CVP who runs this org and made the decision to, for the second year in a row, provide a misogynistic fantasyland for your org's Xmas party: Yes it really was inappropriate for you to use our 1:1s to constantly ask me \"what, no ring yet?\" in reference to my long-time partner, to imply that my son wasn't his, and for you to stare at my breasts constantly.

Not every browser supports the same HTML5 feature set, in a sense we're going back to the bad old Netscape vs IE days with browser specific prefixes.\n\n2. Flash is compiled, giving developers slightly better IP protection\nJavascript is interpreted, anyone can examine your source code and steal your hard work. Flash is compiled, and although it isn't too much harder to decompile flash (since it compiles to byte code), flash obfuscators work a lot better than javascript obfuscators.\n\n3. Flash has the potential to be a lot faster than javascript.\nSince Flash is compiled to byte code like Java and .net, it has the potential to be a lot faster than an interpreted environment like Javascript. In fact, good 'semi compiled' platforms like .net can approach native code in speed, something that no interpreted language can do. Although Flash did perform poorly in most of its life, a bit of work and investment can easily fix that.\n\n4. Flash's security issues were overblown.\nTo say that Flash is bad because it is insecure is ignoring the hundreds of thousands of browser bugs that pop up on every browser, are you telling me that Javascript engines don't have exploits? The perception of flash's security problems actually IMO comes from the time when browsers only displayed simple HTML and Javascript, all the other features were handled by flash. As browser complexity goes up due to rendering engines and javascript engines being forced to handle increasingly larger feature sets, there is a very good chance that we will see more exploits targeting rendering engines and javascript engines. Also, flash's security problems is honestly nothing more developmental effort and investment couldn't fix. \n\ntl;dr: every one of Flash's major issues could have probably been fixed. Fragmentation, performance, and certain other issues with HTML5 + javascript is impossible to fix",

We're that parent with the box of kleenex in one hand and the camera (on burst mode) in the other hand.\n\nWe trust this community more than any other community out there because we have always received a helping hand when we needed it the most. Whether that be in the form of giving feedback while asking nothing in return, support when we hit a wall, a joke to lighten up our day, an introduction to get us to that next step, or the chance to read in and engage with the constant flow of new and exciting content found by the thousands here :)\n\nTruly, no words can ever express our gratitude for HH.\nAnd so as we let our child, UNUM, out into the real world, we hope that all the \"older brothers and sisters\" of this family will be there to help guide and offer their wisdom/advice.\n\nSincerely, \nA worried dad 👨🏻\n",

We'll be going over the basics, and do a few demos -- and it's all online tonight!\n\nhttps://meet.lync.com/stdntpartners/katie.anderson/UFHNU471\n\nAlso, it is in recommended that you do a few things if you wish to follow along or get started doing mobile development with Xamarin.:\n\n1. You need to create your Xamarin account and get your Student License. Go to https://www.xamarin.com/student and follow the on screen instructions. If you already have a dream spark account, you can get started though that, however some students have reported that they get asked for a credit card before completing their sign up. You do not/should not need to enter a credit card to get access to your student license. IF you get asked this, there is another route that you can go. Below the big \"Take me to Microsoft Dream Spark to get started\" button, there is a link that is labeled \"Apply for Xamarin for Students\". This will ask a few basic things like name, Student Email Address, where you are going to school, what country you are in, and a phone number to be reached at. This process takes a few weeks to get your account, but it means no credit card is needed. please try the Dream Spark route first before doing this method due to the short time before the talk.\n\n2. Once you have your account, you will need to set up your environment. Xamarin for Students comes with visual studio integration. however it also has its own stand alone Xamarin Studio which will let you do the exact same things. No matter which path you choose you will need to get your environment installed with the latest mobile SDK's. The installer should do this for you and will walk you though it. If you are stuck or need help, you can look at https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/ which tells you how to get your environment set up. If that does not work, you can reach out to the Midwest's Xamarin MVP at mitchmuenster@gmail.com and he can help you trouble shoot your installation. \n\n3. Finally, you will need to get your phone set up to develop with. \n\nAndroid\nGo to Android Settings / Settings > About Phone \nRepeatedly tap on the section that is titled \"build number\" until you see a message saying \"congrats you are now a developer\"\n\niOS: INPORTANT: you can only develop for iOS if you have a apple desktop or laptop running a non hacked install of OSX. This is an apple mandated thing, you cannot get around it.\nFirst you will have to create your development account. To get started, go to https://developer.apple.com/programs/ and click the blue \"enroll\" button at the top right hand corner.\nPay the $99 USD to activate your apple developer account. There is no \"free\" apple developer program for students\nCreate Provisioning profiles for your accounts for your dev, and production envroments.\nRegister your apple phone or tablet to your developer account, with out doing this you cannot push your app to a iOS device you own.\n\nWindows\nIf you have a dreamspark account you are already most of the way to getting your self set up as a windows phone devloper. to get started follow the guide here https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/alicerp/2013/05/10/students-how-to-set-up-your-free-windows-phone-dev-account-with-dreamspark/",

Because how can we measure someone’s accomplishments without recognizing that not everyone starts in the same place on the race track. Some people start a mile or two back, and then when they don’t finish in first place, we say, 'Well, you didn’t do very good.' When the reality is they ran faster, and they ran longer than any of those other people. The person who ran first place, they just started at a different location. And I think that’s an important part of this conversation, about what is that mile or two back, what makes up that distance.\"",

He buys 5-10 domains for each project to get the maximum traffic possible. After that he sells developed web sites and make a good profit.\n\nThe buyer will pay you the appraised value. It will be fair since he does not want to pay something over the real market value.\n\nBased on my experience, I think your name is in $15,000 - $20,000 range. \n\nDo you have a certificate of the appraised value?\n\nIf you don't have it's not a problem. You can order it online.\n\nHe needs it from a source he knows and trusts.\n\nI’m also interested in a good estimate of the market price because he pays me % on each sale.\n\nThe process is very easy:\n\n1. Go to the certificate agency site (see instructions below) and submit your domain for the certification. Please let them know you have a buyer with $XX,XXX offer. It will help you to get a better valuation. In the comment field please ask them to guarantee that the appraised value will be higher than the appraisal service fee. In this case you will not risk to pay and get a low appraisal. I suggest you this company because they protect you as the seller from getting a low appraised value. They will send you the payment instruction only if your domain is worth $1,000 or higher. Otherwise your request will be declined and you will not pay hem anything. Other companies does not offer this option.\n\n2. If your request will be approved, please pay them the fee and wait for 24 hours. Then send me the results via email and we will start the sale process. As soon as he receives your certificate, he will buy your domain via an escrow service. Any escrow service will be able to pay you via Paypal, Wire, Western Union or any other method you prefer. \n\nHe wants to ensure the safe delivery of the funds to you. Furthermore, since this is our first time conducting any business, I believe that using a third-party escrow service can provide a safe, well defined sale process.\n\nThe certificate must include only 2 things to be accepted by my buyer:\n\n1. Independent valuation of the market price. Only manual valuation is accepted. No valuations generated by scripts.\n\n2. Trademark infringement verification. It proves your domain has no trademark problems. He would like this verification to be included in the appraisal report. It's not a problem because some companies include the TM verification for free.\"",

Around 2,000 badasses are gonna be there: founders, CEOs, product managers, marketers, VPs, directors, engineers, designers, and investors. It’s a great chance to network and learn all while drinking mimosas and having a good time. \n\nTickets are usually $300+ but if you use the promo code “student” you can get a ticket for $50, which covers their cost on hosting the conference (food, drinks, etc.). \n\nI do not work for them but I’m going this year because there's value in ideas contrarian to YC's \"every founder must be technical\".\n\nA lot of Hackathon Hackers are great at building stuff but there's a whole world of additional things that go into building a startup (if that's what you're into). Come build your HUSTLING muscle!\n\n",

                    "message": "Recommend Backend for my App. Maybe a Backend as a service or something like that.  Here's the story - I designed an app that allows people organize and manage events. The app works for two kinds of events: Parties and Formal Events. For Parties, a user is able to generate tickets by entering the number of tickets they want and then selecting a ticket layout and designing the ticket (colors, texts etc). Each ticket has a barcode of the ticket number embedded in it alongside the time and IP address of the machine the ticket was generated from. For formal events, users can paste the names of registered guests from an excel file and the app formats the names and other details into columns. For both parties and formal events, the event organizer is able to check people in with their ticket number or name at the door. At the end of the event, they get a summary of their event and other details. Problem is I can't seem to figure out the backend of the app. I have tried firebase and google real time API but its been super had for me. One of the feedback I got from student groups who have used the app for their event is that they would like to be able to check people into an event from multiple machines simultaneously. I know that for this to happen, I'd need user accounts and the data for each event a user is hosting should be stored with their account so that they can log into multiple devices and check guests. The guestlist should also be able to synch in real time. I can't seem to get the user account and data storage to work. So far, I use local storage to save the data on the users device. The user is also able to generate up to 10,000 tickets and print them, 4 per letter sized paper. Also for formal events, users are able to design and print name badges for their event. Any recommendations? What's the best way to get this working? Anyone good with backend that will wanna help? What service have you tried?",

I have narrowed down what I am going to be doing this summer to two programs:\n\nAll Star Code- a program that lasts for a little more than a month and I would be learning the basic principles of computer science like programming in python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, using those skills to make web apps, and the basics of robotics. \n\nGenCyber- a 11 day program at Marymount University where I would learn the principles of cyber security while living on the college campus. \n\nSo which program should I focus on applying for? I can't do both since the dates overlap. Thank you for any feedback!",

Please comment / PM if you or know anyone who might have any I might be able to borrow!\n\n<3\nJonathan\n\nWant to get involved, have any ideas or see potential problems? Hit me up!\n\nBelow is more information about the project : )\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nImagine you're at a cafe and trying to connect to Wi-Fi. You see a network called \"Do Not Connect\".\n\nClick... you're connected.\n\nA splash screen opens that reads:\n\n> You have stumbled into the Regnevacs Project\n>\n> This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back.\n> If you click the blue 'decline' button or disconnect, the story ends,\n> you will not be able to connect to this wireless network again.\n> If you click the red 'accept' button, you stay in Wonderland and\n> we will show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.\n\nYou click the red button.\n\nOn the screen you read:\n\n> Follow the white rabbit. knock42times\n\nAt the bottom of your screen you see numbers counting down:\n\n> 60...  \n> 59...  \n> 58...\n\nYou quickly take a screenshot.\n\n> 0\n\nYour computer is disconnected. You try reconnecting—but to no avail.\n\nYou search for \"white rabbit\" on Google. You see these two results:\n\n> White Rabbit Tattoo Studio on 121 Essex St.  \n> White Rabbit Tattoo on 249 E 10th St.\n\nYou quickly bike over to the first address. You open your laptop. And there it is, a password protected Wi-Fi network called \"Down The Rabbit Hole\"! You're asked for a password.\n\nHmmm... You type in \"knock42times\"\n\nYou're connected...\n\n### What is Regnevacs?\n\nIt is a scavenger hunt across a city. Clues direct you from one Wi-Fi router to another.\n\n### Technology\n\nRaspberry Pi based Wi-Fi Routers. A router will be about the size of a pack of dryer sheets and can run off battery or AC power.\n\n### Potential Features\n\n#### Hunt Features\n\n- Most Regnevac routers are password protected. You need the clue from the previous router to connect to the next.\n- Some routers will remember the MAC address of the device that connected to it so that the device cannot reconnect twice.\n- Some routers may only be turned on at certain times of the day.\n- The password of the Wi-Fi router may change over time, say based on the weather reported by weather.gov or the day of the week.\n- To expand the number of places people can stumble into the first clue, every router will also broadcast the first clue on a network called \"Do Not Connect\"\n\n#### Administrative Features\n\n- The router is connected to the internet so that (1) the Regnevacs Network can be reconfigured remotely and (2) uptime can be ensured",

From what I know about the software engineering market, employers are still pretty adverse on allowing location-free and flexible environments.\n\nFrom doing a quick Google search there are a few job boards that try to tackle this problem specifically but I'd love to ask the community directly a couple questions on this. \n\n1) Is full-time remote positions something that's desired more than having a team/culture that you can call a family? \n\n2) For those who HAVE been looking for such roles, what's been the hardest thing about this process? \n\nFeel free to add any other thoughts that pop up around this topic. \n\nThanks!",

Should you start drifting off, it vibrates your phone to wake you up. It would recognize that you are falling asleep by reading EEG from your forehead. \n\nI have an opportunity to make something like this. I was wondering if this will address the concern of any one? Personally I hate driving the long drive San Diego to San Francisco because I get sleepy and I feel it's dangerous, especially after 11pm. But sometimes these trips have to be done. If I had something that would recommend me to pull over, or even wake me up if god forbid I DO fall asleep, I'd be psyched. Especially if the whole system cost $40 or less. Want to hear your opinions!",

The best ones I could find are:\n\nMixpanel\nhttps://mixpanel.com\nLiquid\nhttps://onliquid.com/\n\nThese 2 are awesome, but its hard to decide. Mixpanel seems to be the best because its dashboard looks more informative and has really huge and famous customers that work with them.\nMeanwhile, the pricing varies a lot for these. Mixpanel has only 25,000 monthly data points, while Liquid has a million (however, Liquid is not monthly, the free plan will stop after you hit 1 million).\n* A data point is counted every time you track an event. \n\nAnd in the case that you ever do get to the point where you need to pay for more, Mixpanel gives you 500K DP at the next tier, while Liquid gives you unlimited DP but 10K monthly active users. \n\nIt definitely does depend on how many actions you're going to track, but which seems to be the better one?",

It was originally made for bronies to see any online text as if it was written by one, yet you can fully remove this function to replace whatever you want.\nThe download links are in the page below.

Have you ever saw a reddit post on the front page, and you could predict what the top comment was going to be? \n\nPicture of a random animal -> Top comment is a random anecdote with just enough humble brag and humor for all the child comments to post something somewhat similar - all with the purpose of winning e-validation.\n\nOr someone tries to make a point, but tries way to hard like making an entire landing page just to call out some common css library? -> PS what will be the most upvoted response if this was a reddit post? (ITS NOT A LIBRARY ITS A FRAMEWORK HURR DURR)\n\nWhy does this matter to you? Most people won't call you out for it. But I will. And many people who have savy social skills who may hire you, be your business partner, or a very rich client will pick up on your little e-grievances, e-validation-seeks, e-humble-brags, e-passive-aggressive-snarky-comment and most certainly not like you for it.\n\nIt's hard to describe. It's sort of how when a guy who looks good and is well put together is a little bit to needy to a girl he's talking to. Or when you're in a group project and there's one guy that no one gets a long with because he -- just doesn't understand -- how oblivious he is at portraying himself. \n\nDon't let this be you. Here's my advice: If you see something you don't agree with, don't ad-hominem the author. Just ignore it, or remove it from your news feed if it's bothering you too much.\n\nOr before you post something, think about this first. Why do I need to make this point? Is my argument sound? Will people call me out for my fallacies and have that be the most upvoted comment - thus we all know how incompetent your writing skills are right away... yay!. Will it be a soap box drama fest like the last 30 Donald Trump medium articles? WAIT IS THIS EVEN TECH RELATED???!! \n\nI'm sorry. I'm sorry you didn't get enough attention in CS 1101 even after asking 30 questions to the professor you could've just posted on the class forum.",

It’s this website called WayUp, and is basically a job search engine designed specifically for college students. That means the companies are looking for students like YOU and not someone with 2+ years of prior job experience. On WayUp you can find a multitude of awesome jobs and internships for companies like Disney, Uber, Google, and more. It makes the whole application process SO much easier, trust me. I hope you can take 30 seconds to check it out!\n\nHere’s a link for you to get started: ",

I know this feels super spam-y and that some of you probably assume that I’m just trying to get more referrals, but I promise you that this really is a good website that has a ton of job listings that would be a good fit for you. Through WayUp, I personally got two campus jobs and I’ve had two of my friends score awesome internships that were great for their majors and even better resume boosters!

After talking with members of said team and authorities within MLH and hackathon organizers, it should be noted that there was no major infraction in the work presented. It has been agreed that the work was not represented for what it was at the time, but since then, several measures have been taken to clarify the aspects in question of the product's lineage. \n\nIn lieu of these events I think a general warning is in order: \n\nInstances such as this, where teams have falsely advertised and misrepresented what \"they\" created have happened at every single hackathon I have been to. Obviously, in a short time frame it is extremely hard to learn and implement a technology without ripping code from stack overflow or a random Github account (honestly, we've all been there). However, stealing a large portion of a prior project is just dishonest. Collaborating and building on previous ideas is important to growing the tech community at large, but doing things like this only tarnishes the reputation of Hackathons in general. \n\nIn the end, make sure you cite and explain any code that is from a prior source, explain your advancement of a preexisting technology if you've refactored one, and make sure to elaborate on things that you personally did. Be proud of your work, not someone else's.\n\nPeace, and Happy Hacking!",

Basically, you are given everything you need to work on an open source project: money and mentorship.\n\nFirst, you'll grow a lot. But second, there are a lot of understaffed and impactful organizations out there where your work could have a huge impact.\n\nMy favorite on the list is definitely the Tor Project, which is now led by Shari Steele, who ran the EFF for 15 years. Think \"advancing human rights where it intersects with technology, by building better technology\".\n\nWhich one of the organizations looks the most interesting to you? The number of projects on that list that I depend on every day is astounding. https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/",

I want to take the first string and, whenever a match for my regex in the first string is exactly my second string, replace that part with my third string.

Any tips?\n\nEdit: Example:\nfirst string is \"abcd_a\", regex = \"[a-z]*\", second string is \"a\" and third is \"b\"\n\nresult is \"abcd_b\" because the regex would match \"abcd\" (but not replace it because it is not exactly \"a\") and the final 'a' (which it would replace because it is exactly \"a\")",

If it gets a 403, the user is redirected to the login page, otherwise the promise succeeds and the page is loaded.\n\nThe problem is, before the resolve completes, a part of the page gets loaded and shown in the browser, then its redirected to login.

How many ways to add Nth node?\n- distribute 1 edge between node N and any of the other N-1 nodes; this is trivial - given N-1 choose 1.\n- distribute 2 edges between ....\n- . . .\n- distribute N-1 edges between ....\n\nA more detailed post is here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35743318/number-of-simple-connected-graphs-with-n-labeled-vertices-and-k-unlabeled-edges\n\nI have found another way to solve this problem, but would like to know how my first approach could be modified cause the other approach makes O(NK) recursive calls and K is on average quadratic in N.\n\nThe full source in Java is here: https://github.com/dray92/Google-Foobar/blob/master/Undercover_Underground.java",

We empower entrepreneurs by using beacons to drive foot-traffic to retailers by incentivizing users with exclusive content. We do this with a streaming app(Setmine) & a retailer app(Setstory). While this model is proving out, our goal is to become the main bridge between content & location. To create the most widely-used content-based beacon network, we plan on perfecting our API & integrating it into first, other streaming platforms, then next, any content distributor. We're now early in the process of working with other streaming platforms.\n\nWe're looking for our next JS or Swift Engineer who's looking to stay long enough to eventually be Head of Mobile or API Director. I don't care if you don't know either language though, if music is your passion & you love learning, reach out anyways. If you're applying for JS, React is a plus but not a requirement.\n\nOffer: \n-No living expenses. Food & rent is completely covered. Your own room in the Sethau5 office/house(on Las Olas Blvd, Fort Lauderdale, Florida). \n-$500 - $2000/Monthly salary on top of all living expenses paid. \n-Room to jump vertically or horizontally. Seriously, I don't care what your skillset is, if music & coding is your thing let me know. If you want to try something completely left-field(sales, marketing, design, operations)...we'll make it work. \n-Lifestyle perks. We're always open to spending the weekends at hackathon, learning a new skill, music tech meetups, & events/festivals. Also Friday is Art Day, working on another \"art,\" is encouraged all day. \n-Equity. Anywhere from 1% - 5%. Up to you to negotiate.\n\nAbout: https://www.setmine.com/about\n\n***If this gets some interest going(25+ comments) I'll give you guys a periscope tour of the Sethau5***",

It's amazing that we are able to pull it off in less than 48 hours.\n\nSubmitting it on time is not the biggest accomplishment, however. Regardless of the outcome, the coolest thing about entering highly competitive contests like this one with friends is that we are able to work collaboratively, efficiently, and become much more closer friends after knowing that we can depend on each other.\nSpecial thanks for Bry Troyer for your never ending support with editing text in the project page https://github.com/CelestialProphecy/script2Bit as well as special rush job on the final submission form. Without your help, the comma splice and run-on sentences will be running on and on and on and on without ending. And, it was down to the wire also. So, thank you for being there for me and for the [Squad] Team, my friend.\n\nOnce again, from the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU MY FRIENDS! :)\n\nPS: script2Bit is one of the module that will be integrated into a much larger pre-, post-, and production software for film makers. Thank you so much for all your input!! (https://www.facebook.com/Wise.Cricket/posts/10104684218056368) So stay tuned! :)\n\nscript2Bit Features:\n* Upload or copy paste script\n* Script breakdown\n* Script to Call Sheet conversion\n* Scenes Visualization\n* Email and/or text notifications to cast and crew\n#Koding #SquadTeam #Hacksummit",

After working for 2 years at 32 companies in 27 countries on 7 continents I wanted to make meaningful work-life experiences more accessible for our generation. That's why I just (beta)launched: www.wanderbrief.com\n\nWanderbrief is a global community where people exchange their creativity for meaningful work-life experiences abroad. Everyone is welcome and I hope to see some HH around as well. Besides that we might need some developers at Wanderbrief HQ in Amsterdam soon since we've already got 3500 creatives from 42 countries who created a profile in our first week. \n\nPlease let me know what you think about it and/or if you have any questions/tips. Thanks!\n\nWarm regards from Amsterdam,\nMark",

I'd like to get better with mock interviews, if anyone is willing to skype or google hangouts with me for an hour over the next couple of days or weeks. I live in NYC and plan to stay in NYC, so that should make searching for leads a little easier.\n\nI've read Cracking the Code Interview and sometimes get help from my programmer friends, but could use a more systematic approach.

I'm part of Texas Guadaloop, a team of graduate and undergraduate students building the Hyperloop transportation pod. The Hyperloop is a new mode of transportation that ferries people from city to city at 700 mph (imagine a hovercraft cruising through a evacuated tube). SpaceX, a private rocket manufacturing company, has allowed us to advance to the build process and test our pod on their test track. This is an opportunity to make a futuristic transportation technology a modern reality, radically improving how we travel day to day. Just think, by June 2016, we'll know if the Hyperloop is truly possible. Would you be able to share, donate, and help us go viral? See gofundme.com/texasguadaloop and check out our DOPE video!

Especially those who just happen to be in town for a few days\n- A ton of toys (Arduinos, drones, robots)\n- Ton of desk space in a lounge space, suitable for multiscreen setups for those who want that\n- 2 WiFi connections (just in case..)\n- Goes without saying: fastest internet possible\n- You come up with ideas\n\nNeighborhood: No big preference. Preferably Manhattan below 110th street, or Brooklyn with max 2 stops away from Manhattan.\nRent: no clue yet, but let's aim for the ~2000 USD per room or less range.\n\nLet me know in case you're interested: iam@faridelnasire.com",

Currently, the number of emails that need to be sent in one go is 116. \n\nIt's all written in Django. Previously, I used gmail to send the automated emails but got banned. So I had to use my hostgator server (the same one where I'm hosting my frontend wordpress site). It worked fine for a lot of months but now it seems they've banned me as well. \n\nThey have very similar content and are sent frequently, so the servers think I'm sending spam. I do make sure to include instructions on unsubscribing from these emails at the bottom, but it doesn't seem to help. I've heard of zoho mail and amazon SES and stuff. I'm not sure what they look for in a good non-spammy email.\n\nWhat's the proper way to send these notification emails? Does anyone have any experience with this?",
