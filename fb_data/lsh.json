You should subscribe to https://tinyletter.com/techspeak, which contains calls for speakers (aka google forms where you submit talk ideas), as well as general speaking advice and other good links.\n\n2. Working on a talk submission or trying to brainstorm ideas? Ping me and I'll give you my feedback. I can't promise to respond super-quickly but I'd like to do this for at least a few LSHers. :)\n\n3.

We are trying to set up an ACM chapter in my college since the major focus is on competitive programming & next to none on other aspects of CS. We have 3 ACM members plus a faculty sponsor as per the requirements stated here: http://www.acm.org/chapters/students/students/form-gen-interest, but the Indian ACM Council require that the other 5-6 people supporting the chapter should also become members even though it's not stated in the requirements for creating a chapter. The major hurdle is that it's very difficult to convince students in my college to purchase the ACM membership costing about 1000 INR without the chapter even existing as it's not a small sum to pay for any student. So if you guys know anyone who is an ACM member and will be willing to help us bring this chapter to life, I'll be very thankful!

We have a Google Developers Group (GDG) chapter in our college and Women Tech Makers (WTM) is subsidiary of it meant to increase participation of women in technical events/workshops. Last semester, we had a small coding competition and restricted the entry to just girls. About 10 females showed up, which was disappointing as the gender ration in my college isn't that bad, it's decent. \nWhen I came to college, I used to be the only female in code meets organised weekly. Well, it used to feel a little weird and intimidating having not one other female in the entire room filled by guys coding away at their laptops. Later, to rectify incidents like these my senior and I decided to start a Facebook group for girls who are interested in different areas of CS and help them find the right direction so that they don't feel lost or clueless. I was told that I'm \"splitting\" groups further and a separate group isn't needed at all as everyone can collaborate and learn. Once, I called out a guy for blatant sexism during recruitment for a club and was called sexist for having formed a girls-only club. What I don't understand is -- why do people harbour such notions? Where do they stem from? \n\nI've also been told that companies who aim at recruiting females specifically are taking away opportunities from men -- it's not fair to them as the girls just have to compete with the girls while the boys have to compete with everyone. It's basically saying that you're not good enough to compete with the boys, so we'll just put you up against the girls and see who wins. Has anyone had a similar experience? How to tackle these kind of issues as they are incredibly disturbing?",

I already met with my supervisors and they gave me some very candid feedback on both the positives and negatives. One of the major negatives was that they thought I was not assertive and communicative enough. \n\nThroughout my 3 months there, I felt like I was constantly chasing people down (clients/teammates) but getting brushed off, which slowed the pace of my turnarounds. I thought it would be enough to politely remind them a few times a day, whether it would through Slack or in person. But it seems like it wasn't cutting it.\n\nHas anyone experienced this? I wonder how I can adjust my communication style moving forward. Maybe it was just something with the team dynamic that didn't mesh well. \n\nAlso, I am debating on taking some time off between the end of the contract and jumping onto the next to reflect on my next steps.\n\nThoughts?",

I felt really unqualified and having this community to write helpful & encouraging comments and messages made me feel a lot better. \n\nWomen in Tech communities often talk about Imposter Syndrome -- feeling like you don't deserve the successes you've been handed, or that you're not worthy of your accomplishments, or that you are horrible at something that you're actually really good at. The problem is that this conversation leaves out those of us who really ARE behind, learning, or struggling. If the conversation is always about Imposter Syndrome, people who are really lost, confused, or not-yet-qualified get left out of the picture. \n\nI want to start a discussion about overcoming insecurities and failures. I feel much better now than I did 8 months ago, but I still remember what it felt like for all of those years of being unqualified. \n\n- Does anyone feel unprepared for an internship or job? \n- Is anyone else struggling with trying to find \"their place\" in the tech industry? \n- How have you overcome these feelings (if you have)?\n\n----------------------------------- Edit/Addition -----------------------------------\nI made this post because I don't think that lack of confidence is always \"Imposter Syndrome\". I think it's dangerous to ONLY have the \"Imposter Syndrome\" conversation, because talks about this have an arc like \"I thought I was horrible, but then I won 4 hackathons in a row and landed [Amazing Job] at [Amazing Company]! Wow, totes underestimated myself\". The problem is that this not relatable for everyone. When we are just starting out, we are not all landing great internships, winning great hackathons, getting amazing grades. For those of us who feel like we don't measure up - and have the rejections to prove it - I wanted to talk about how we can help each other get better & develop confidence to find our place in this industry!!",

I also want to let the younger and less experienced members in LSH know that it's totally okay to be a complete beginner, to be very clueless, and to just be excited about tech even if you don't have the skills yet. Thinking of a product idea and creating an interactive prototype for it is a wonderful way to get started. \n\nI have a 1-hour UX design workshop that I've run once in-person (hey Joanne Ma) and will be running again in January, but I want to refine it so I can reach more people, pass on my skills, and continue to improve the slide deck and teaching process. \n\nIf you are totally new to design thinking or UX design, and if you've never successfully made a wireframe or interactive prototype before, I would love to walk you through the workshop in a 1-hour video hangout in a small group. Let me know if you're interested by commenting and we'll schedule times after! \n\n** It is too basic for people with design experience, so you're welcome to join and give me feedback on how I can improve the workshop, but you probably won't learn much! :P",

This is harder to implement but would ensure that people were actually on panels relevant to them and could talk about their jobs, instead of just talking about \"lady stuff\"-- i.e. Wojcicki could be on a panel with Joseph Gordon Levitt of HitRecord, John Green of VlogBrothers, and the CEO of Vimeo to talk about the future of online video. Jessica Alba could be on a panel with the founders of Beautified, Gwenyth Paltrow of Goop, and Michelle Phan to talk about beauty & lifestyle brands in the digital age. Wouldn't this make a lot more sense and allow the focus of the talks to be about their actual products? Of course this was about Salesforce so those topics might not exactly fit THIS conference-- but then invite people whose professions are relevant to the conference and actually let them talk about their professions.\n\nAnother question is-- are we then in a Catch-22 because it will be nearly impossible to ensure that every conference has adequate representation from many different genders, racial & ethic groups, LGBTQ people, etc.? Is it better to have these messy panels than nothing at all? \n\n",

In Fall 2013, I \"founded\" a group for college women in tech called The Violet Society. I made it because orgs for older women weren't targeted towards my needs, and those for middle school or other young students were similarly mismatched. Quotes are because we had very few events (all in Summer 2014) and I never put in enough time to grow it. Now that I'm in NYC I am loving the tech community here, and I thought that if I started it up more seriously it could be amazing. \n\nMVP Components of The Violet Society:\n- Weekly hacking meetups focused on a specific tool or product. Hopefully can get one for beginngers \"The Lavender Society\" :), one for intermediate learners, and one combined (I was thinking Tuesdays--the other Tuesday we would go to NY Tech Meetup and hang out before/after) \n- Female-focused healthy hackathons twice a year (start planning when/if weekly meetups are working)\n- Facebook group (already exists) and mailing list (already exists) \n\nEdited this post because I think I explained it better in my Medium post: \nhttps://medium.com/the-violet-society/what-young-women-in-tech-really-need-c499eaaf1344\n \nThanks",

Some of you know me so already know all of this...sorry I keep asking the same thing I'm just really confused. :(  \n\nSo i just graduated this spring with a degree in Comp Sci from Tufts. I took 5 years to do it because I decided on it in my 3rd year and kind of struggled through classes because I didn't put as much time into them as i should have. I want to work in web or mobile dev as my career but I was intimidated since we didn't learn that in classes and had to teach ourselves outside of class (I'm not so great at that...I didn't like messy code and hacky solutions because I didn't understand what I was doing or why it worked).\n\nAs a result I feel confident about my UX design, HTML, and CSS skills but not so hot on anything like Javascript / Python / Ruby. I'm learning iOS dev this summer at make school but I don't think I'll be good enough for an entry-level iOS dev position (i'm applying to them anyway though). I am looking into iOS internships (if they'll take someone who has already graduated) but also considering going to make school's 2 year program (https://www.makeschool.com/) BUT - then my parents will have to support me financially for another 1-2 years. They're not really ready to do that but they could if I was desperate; on the other hand I want to grow up and have a job already...I just don't want to hate the company I work at. \n\nDo you know anyone who like pulled an \"Intern Queen\" (http://www.internqueen.com/content/about-lauren-berger) situation for dev jobs so they could learn on the job and actually get paid? Would that work? Should I just get any full-time job I can find? My ultimate goal is to work at a really world-changing company like Khan Academy but they are also super competitive. I know my skills right now are not even close to where they need to be for that kind of job but I want to get there as soon as I can. \n\nWhat will get me there if I really put my all into it? Full-time / multiple internships / Make School / something else? \n\nAny and all advice is highly appreciated. I tend to get defensive easily so I'll try not to because I really value everyone in this group. <3 And if anyone is in a similar situation to me (don't feel like their degree or experience prepared them for a dev job, not sure what to do now), let me know what you're doing or what you're deciding between.",

I couldn't help but get really frustrated at how frequently the author notes the social ties between the founders of this brand and everyone who invests in or helps along their business. Even though they didn't start a tech company, I know that a lot of us are interested in creating products that people love and that drive is there for non-tech consumer brands too. Having an old-world network of privileged individuals clearly helped these co-founders immensely, but many of us don't have that kind of network because of the place we grew up, our race, our gender, socioeconomic status, or other reasons. \n\nOn one hand, I am relieved and excited that because of groups like LSH, we can create our own brain trusts and basically democratize networking, so you don't have to be in any kind of network other than the free & internationally used Facebook to meet smart people.\n\nOn the other hand I wonder what those of us who are less-connected can do to develop personal relationships with powerful/influential people who are our potential investors, advisors, etc. if we DON'T have a younger cousin who goes to school with their kid, or don't have uncles who were old college buddies.\n\n",

Yesterday I volunteered at Jewelbots' \"Take your Daughter to Hack Day\" and met this awesome 11-year-old girl named Kika who has already been teaching herself how to code with Codecademy and Khan Academy. She's done HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery and she started PHP & Ruby but some exercises were broken so she couldn't continue (or she got stuck and the hints didn't help). She got to see littleBits for the first time at the hack day and she loved those too! \n\nHer family lives in Brooklyn, NY but they can't find summer programs for people around her age that actually focus on programming (instead of \"look at how fun technology is\" topics like 3D printing or Minecraft, or tours of Google and such where you just walk around an *get inspired* instead of learning/building). \n\nI showed her how to make her own website using Github pages and wrote out a guide so she can replicate the git commands in the Terminal and connected our accounts on Khan Academy so I can coach/mentor her but it was disappointing to see that things like Girls Who Code are only for older girls and other programs were not really teaching much (and they were very expensive-- around $1,000 for one week).\n\nThought I would ask this group-- do you know any programs or opportunities that would really help her accelerate her learning? I'm in Make School now so I'm going to ask them if she could join next summer as a 12 year old but for this year I need to find something that hasn't started yet that I could recommend!\n\n>> Edit: Made a GoFundMe to buy a littleBits kit for her http://www.gofundme.com/2tc8s8 <<",

So far she has been doing it by hand (!!!) and asked for anyone who is interested in helping her out (either by hand also or automated with a script that searched for masculine or feminine pronouns on random wiki pages) to let her know! I was too far away to write down contact info but you can probably send her a tweet (she responded to mine pretty fast). She is going to present her findings in Mar 2015 at various galleries and community spaces, I think it's an exciting project and if someone has experience with web scraping or data visualization it seems like automating this would make it much easier and faster!!",

This feels like a dream, having been accepted to Google I/O comes as a huge surprise, and I really want to go. However, as a first gen college student, I don't have the $300 to pay for the ticket. Do any of y'all have any connections to companies or organizations who may be able to help me out by sponsoring my ticket? Or does anyone have any ideas on how to fund this? I honestly have no clue, so I'm reaching out to y'all for your help.\n\nUPDATE: Lovely people, I was able to get sponsorship but I also have a friend, Karen,who is in the same situation that I was in. She is a low-income first generation college student and a woman of color who needs help financing her ticket. She just started her GoFundMe campaign (https://www.gofundme.com/228dp4ta), if y'all could help out, that would be amazing. I love this community and all the support y'all have given me, I hope I can pay it forward and help Karen as well. :)",

I'm not sure how to go about this or if I can ask for another extension? Any ideas or suggestions?",

A common concern for hackathons I've seen floating around was how much corporate sponsors influence the goals of the event. Though I understand the value they bring, I feel like well intentioned ones would still participate without plastering their names all across that title sponsor banner. It would also lower the barrier to entry for smaller startups who can't afford the inflating sponsor packages.\n\nConcerns: What would you even provide though to individual patrons? If you become a non-profit, I guess you could tap into alumni for tax deduction? \n\nJust think there should perhaps be a change in sponsorship structuring of the events we've all come to love.",

Square's Code Camp was an incredibly well put together and rewarding experience. The summary is that you are flown out to SF for 5 days (free). \n\nHonestly, when I first applied, I expected the experience to be a week of drinking the Square Kool-Aid. It wasn't. In fact, they weren't imposing at all. The impression was just immense support. Throughout the week, we attended technical and leadership workshops including topics like Security, Machine Learning, and Imposter Syndrome. At the end of each day, we worked in groups to work on an app. \n\nI have to say, that this is the moment where I realized how supportive Square was, because some mentors stayed until like 1am to help us. We also visited Twitter and Uber, as well as being introduced to Yelp's women engineers. We also got to meet incredibly leaders like Sarah Friar (Square CFO) and Jack Dorsey (Square CEO).\n\nThe support continues because you are added to a Facebook group of Code Camp alumni who I have no doubt would be willing to support me professionally. \n\nIf you don't get in the first time, apply again. I know one of the girls in my class applied at least like 3 times. There are so many ladies among LSH who I had no idea were part of this program. Everyone there is amazing and inspirational. If you have any more questions, comment below. \n\n",

Through various experiences, I realized that the interview is a two way street and that you are seeing if that company is a match for you as well. \n\nA few I thought about:\n\n- What is your full time conversion like? (i.e. I know that for a few companies, you have to re-interview. Which may/may not be a problem. For me, its something to consider as a rising senior and whether I want to deal with that post-graduation. Are you going to be dropped with an exploding offer situation? i.e. accept this offer within 3 days or we don't want you. Which if you encounter this situation... I'll go on a limb and say that you probably shouldn't accept cuz it reflects poorly on the company's recruiting practices.)\n\n- Can you give me an overview of your deployment process? (If its not streamlined, its probably going to be a bit frustrating. Also, I <3 code review.)\n\n- Can you specifically tell me what mentorship is like? For instance, how do you mentor a junior developer to become a senior developer? (This is probably more specific to larger companies. I personally am hunting for a mid - large size company to start out in.)\n\n- How easy is it to switch teams if you are not happy with the project you are on? (This may or may not matter. But it would suck if you had to stick with a team that you were not excited about.)\n\nA lot of these questions also probably apply more/less to full time offers.

It has and still serves it purpose as a launch platform for women and their supporters to be in turn supported and heard in the hackathon community. I have found countless resources and made many friends.\n\nThat being said. It has come to my attention that as the community size has grown, even I do not feel comfortable posting certain things. It is an innate problem in any large online community when you do not know who exactly is in the group. This would still be a problem even in an all woman's group of 50 people. This group is now strongly 1450. \n\nThis past month, I started a secret group of 8 people with peers that I trust and know. It has been an awesome ride. Though we are only 8 people, the group is extremely active and the conversation is incredibly engaging. We sometimes talk about tech, feminism, I update them on my life events. Its great. The group probably won't ever grow larger than 10 people. The personal support and guidance it has provided, is immeasurable. The women in the group are from all over the US, and its been pretty awesome.\n\nI strongly, strongly encourage you to try this little social experiment. Spawn your own **secret** groups of peers within this community. Or outside for that matter. Don't let it grow bigger than maybe 10 people. If you need help finding a group, post here, we can all try to help you out. Be personal, talk about non-tech things. Basically, just be friends who happen to have the common interest of hackathons/tech. \n\nIf you see someone looking for a group, and you have space, privately message them and add them. \n\nMost importantly... HAVE FUN! Muahahahaha. \n\nPeace out home skillets.",

What requests would you like for the interview series? Got questions? \n\nOur first interviewer will be Cassidy (Venmo's Dev Evangelist). And she will be interviewing Diana + Niti LIVE at 7pm. The 2nd hour will consist of Cassidy answering questions about this week's topic.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/1511246509133837/",

But the development team is super laid back and smaller. Lol...if you come, feel free to poke fun at the pm from the bronx. He's pretty cool. \n- the CEO always takes the time to talk to us and makes sure we still like our jobs lol.

The environment is super communicative, helpful, and the standards for female excellence are already super high. It's really nice not having to represent my entire gender in everything I do, and not having to constantly fight stereotypes in order to simply get my job done. \n\nAnyway I'm super pumped and I just wanted to share!

Hospitals like these desperately need clothing, so I'm thinking of doing this huge donation haul of tech shirts/any other clothing you don't want any more. Specifically, underwear is something they desperately need. \n\nPlease message/comment if you would like to help with this cause!\n\nDetails: \n\nSt. Helena's Hospital Center For Behavioral Health\n\nAddress: \n525 Oregon Street\nVallejo, CA 94590\n\nYou can just put everything in a box and mail it to them using the address above. I would also include a little note saying how these are donations (from ______). For those of you on the east coast, I *highly* recommend contacting mental hospitals in the area so you won't have to pay expensive shipping. \n\nAlso, I plan on writing an iOS app revolving around mental health (WebMD for disorders, pill notifications, disorder information, treatment options, hospital ratings, etc).

I dont want to spend a whole lot of money, but also want something that's good quality (under $500-ish pls). Also any web designers if you could holla@me with tips for how I can be you I would be eternally grateful :))",

[White-hat] Hack the government. Do it. Make it better, please. \n\n** Mention in your online application that I referred you as a member of Ladies Storm Hackathons/Hackathon Hackers. **\n----------\n\"Why We Need You in Government\n\nPosted by Mikey Dickerson \n\nEditor’s Note: Mikey Dickerson, Administrator of the U.S. Digital Service, and Jen Pahlka, former Deputy CTO of the United States and founder of Code for America, gave a talk at the 2015 SXSW Music, Film + Interactive Festival on “How Government Fails and How You Can Fix It.”  For those who weren’t there, here’s Mikey’s opening remarks:\n\nThis all started for me in October 2013.  Healthcare.gov had just launched, and if you remember, it wasn't going too great.  I was minding my own business in California working for Google.  Although I had volunteered for the Obama campaigns, I had no other connection to the Administration and no government experience at all.\n\nI was visiting some friends from the campaign in Chicago when through some complicated series of connections that I still don't understand, I heard that the White House was looking to organize some kind of assessment of the website, and was asked to call in to a phone conference where I would get more information.  The phone call was at 8:30 Eastern, so 5:30AM for me, so I was not too happy but I did it anyway.  On the phone was a guy named Todd Park.  I had never met Todd; I looked him up on Wikipedia while on the phone.  With a couple more phone calls, I was talked into flying to Washington, D.C. for a few days to evaluate the situation.\n\nHere was the situation when I got there: The government shutdown was over, and the failure of Healthcare.gov was the lead story on cable news all day every day.  The original estimate from the Congressional Budget Office had been that 7 million people would enroll in this first enrollment period, but Todd said that given the circumstances if we could manage 4 million, that would be a home run.  He said they needed an independent outside team to figure out how bad the problems were and if they could be fixed to save the site this year. Also that if it couldn't be fixed, then it would be a catastrophe for the policy, with the 2014 election coming and the unpopular law having failed to launch.  Democrat support would probably fracture, the election would be a disaster, the President would be a lame duck two years early, and nobody would try again for a generation.  But you know, we want your honest assessment.\n\nWe looked around and found some really surprising things.  One was that there was no monitoring of the production system.  For those of you that run large distributed systems, you will understand that this is as if you are driving a bus with the windshield covered.  Second was that there were hundreds of people and dozens of companies involved, but nobody in charge.  Third was that there was no particular urgency about the situation.   As I would come to understand, nobody was acting like there was anything out of the ordinary because there was nothing out of the ordinary.  The whole system had worked as normal and produced the expected result, which was a web site that was overpriced by hundreds of millions of dollars and did not work, at all.\n\nSince there were so many really basic problems, we ended up recommending that the site could probably be fixed to work well enough to enroll the 4 million people.  Of course, we were then asked to stay to follow through and implement those recommendations.  (This is called commitment escalation, and we will do it to you.  This is the only time I will warn you.)  I ended up going home in January—my 3 day trip had turned into nearly 3 month stint.  I submitted an invoice for the nine week period ending December 31, 2013, and the mean hours per day worked was 17.5.  I was hallucinating and having other problems from not having slept enough for three months.  This was the hardest thing I have ever done and I hope nothing ever comes close to it again.\n\nWhen I went home, other people had taken over the day to day operations and helped finish the enrollment period, which went to March 31.  But things did not go back to normal for me; they only continued to get weirder.  There had already been media interest in the people from the \"tech surge,\" and in March the final enrollment number of over 8 million was announced, and three of us from the “tech surge” team were on the cover of Time Magazine.  In May I went back one more time for an event where we met the President.\n\nI tell you all this not to prove how amazing we were, but exactly the opposite.  Nothing we did was technically difficult by any standard we are used to.  There were simple problems with simple solutions.  The solution to the lack of monitoring was to install monitoring.  The solution to nobody being in charge was to make everybody come to the same room where we could coordinate.  And so on.  It was not a hard engineering problem, and any of you could have done it, and it was also more important and meaningful than anything I could have accomplished in a lifetime working at my old job.  Beyond the 8 million people that got access to health care for the first time, which for many of them was a matter of life or death, I don't think we are ever going back to the time when people who actually need health insurance are not allowed to buy it.\n\nSo I went back to my old job and tried to care about it.  I was not successful.  On one hand the company does not need me; there are thousands of other engineers that are as good or better.  On the other hand, if I succeeded beyond anybody's wildest dreams the net effect is that some extra billions of dollars would go to one billionaire instead of a different billionaire.  It was hard to see why I should bother, and still is.\n\nBut meanwhile, there were wheels turning in Washington, D.C., where people that had been working on government technology reform for years had received a huge boost from the Healthcare.gov meltdown.  So pretty soon Todd Park was calling me again, asking me to come work for a group that has now become known as the U.S. Digital Service.  It took a few months to convince me, but in August I finally left Google forever and moved to Washington.\n\nThe basic theory of the U.S. Digital Service was to replicate the ingredients that were successful on turning around Healthcare.gov, for a few other high priority projects.  With the money we basically had left over in an IT oversight fund, I expected to hire about 10 to 12 people and take on three projects, which I thought would be the Affordable Care Act, the VA, and immigration.  I expected that the difficult problems would be recruiting 10 more engineers to make this questionable life decision, and getting agencies to accept outside help.\n\nSince then several unexpected things have happened.  Where I was worried about recruiting 10 people, I actually got over a thousand applications.  The demand from the agencies is also more than we could ever satisfy.  We have met with 22 of them and identified around 60 projects that need attention.  And possibly the most surprising thing was that Congress passed an omnibus spending bill in December, and it included the full $20M funding request to operate the U.S. Digital Service.  This will allow us to grow to about 40 people and take on 10 projects in 2015.\n\nAnd this is the part where you come in.  Right now, at least, in this moment, we have overwhelming demand for engineers like yourself in the federal government.  And we have overwhelming supply of people that want to come help.  For these reasons, we have proposed in the President's 2016 budget a total of $105 million to create copies of the U.S. Digital Serivce team inside all of the 24 major agencies, for a total of around 500 people.  The artificial barrier that has kept the technology industry and the public sector separated on different evolutionary paths is porous right now, and if enough people cross over, it can be destroyed.\n\nSome of you, not all of you, are working right now on another app for people to share pictures of food or a social network for dogs.  I am here to tell you that your country has a better use for your talents.  The Affordable Care Act, I just told you about.  The Social Security Administration mails checks from a mainframe running COBOL, which might kind of be OK except that more than half of the workforce that maintains it is at or near retirement age.  What happens then?  The Department of Veterans Affairs has a serious backlog of disability claims.  The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service processes permanent resident applications and everything else on paper.  If you lose your green card, it will take you 6-8 months to get a new one and in the meantime you will not be able to prove you have the right to be in the country or get a job.   All of these are information processing problems and all of these are matters of life or death to millions of citizens and all of them are things you can fix if you choose to.\n\nSo that's what it all boils down to.  This is a market economy and you—and your talents—are the crucial capital. Whether you know it or not, you are making decisions about how we allocate resources.  We can solve any of these problems but we have to choose to do it.  The most sobering thing about my time in government is to really understand on an emotional level that this country belongs to you and me and it is exactly as good as we make it.  Grownups are not going to fix it for us and billionaires are not going to fix it for us.  We either do it ourselves, or nobody does.  I will take questions.\n\nReady to get involved?

This year, we reached over 800 girls nationally through our competition and regional workshops and this coming year (2015-2016) will be our third year running the program. We've partnered with several national women in tech organizations and have received corporate sponsorship and national press coverage for our work. \n\nApplications are now open to all interested high school and undergraduate students to join the 2015-2016 ProjectCSGIRLS team so if you’re interested, please fill out the form below by July 30th 11:59 PM EST.

We've tried to make it both fun and beautiful in terms of animations.\n\nHere's the link to register: https://goo.gl/Hc4GfV\n\nSignup is free for everyone and there will be cool prizes to win (HTC Vive Headset, Myo armband, Geekbox).\n\nIf you want to practice a little bit and check what the environment looks like, we advise you to start with 2 solo puzzles:\n- \"Surface\": https://goo.gl/TYDa0P\n- \"Gravity\": https://goo.gl/OZe0vB\n\nThanks for checking!",

I don't know if it was our teacher or just me being me (not the first class I've failed), but in general, I want to ask how people have dealt with their feelings of inadequacy in the classroom. Feeling like you're hopeless, you can't possibly do as well as the other people in your class, all the opportunities you've gotten were flukes somehow. I'm basically quoting my inner monologues right now. I dunno, it's a destructive thing, and I'm about to be a senior and if I can learn to help myself deal with these feelings productively, I'd like to do it sooner rather than later.\n\nAlso, because Algs is so important, what are texts/videos/courses that you guys might have used to learn them well? This summer I was going to read through a text book and teach myself. I'm armed with enough background knowledge and general knowledge that I won't be starting from square one, but anyone has any advice for that, it would be great!\n\n(also I hope this post isn't too off topic; I didn't really know where else I could ask such questions.)",

So, I'm looking to you to help me crowd source university cs diversity data.  I'm very interested in feedback on how this could be improved, some initial notes are the I'm focusing on gender and race (and leaving out some other important categories) because I don't actually think the other data exists, but if it does-- please prove me wrong!  Also, I am absolutely aware that gender is not a binary, but again I worry that the remaining data doesn't exist. However I'd be thrilled to be wrong, so add what you know.",

I figured I'd give you guys some protips so you go in less noobie than me!  \n\n1.) Make sure you submit your resume @ GHC's resume drop:\nhttp://gracehopper.anitaborg.org/resume-database/\n\nWhy should you do this? \nFirstly, lots of companies go through their database to interview candidates, generally at the conference itself. I, noobishly, did not do this. \nSecondly, lots of companies have dinners where they have girls come in to talk to developer/reps from the company. (Pinterest and DropBox to name a few from last year) \n\n2.) Make sure you go to the tech fair, earlier the better. Some companies give out interviews at the job fair. \n\n3) If GHC has the talk on Office Politics, I recommend it! I think last year it was by Jo Miller( googled it: http://gracehopper.anitaborg.org/ghc-community-blog/ghc14/ghc14-winning-at-the-game-of-office-politics-part-2/ so I'm not positive but thats what this implies ).  It gives you some protips on how to view the work place and the small things that may go unnoticed if it wasn't brought to your attention.\n\n4) I saw some people asking how to dress. \n---> wear what you want, texas is going to be hot! \n---> jeans and t-shirt is fine \n---> if you're like me and you're like, uhh that feels a little awkward for me, then cardigan/blazer/jean jacket if you want with dress/jeans/leggings with flats/sandals is totally fine. \n--> Really. I swear. Id stay away from sweatpants though! \n\n5) to my earlier point about the dinners companies hold, when at the tech fair, i'd just ask if they have one and if you can go. Some people told me about theirs, others, I found out later, were open and I missed an opportunity. \n\n6) Network. You're going to be around a lot of leading ladies, so be bold! Everyone from a company will probably be wearing their shirt, so go ahead and ask away! I wish I had asked more :P \n\nGOOD LUCK AND HAVE FUN :)",

I'd really love your advice about doing an internship this summer with a large corporate company versus a small start up. \n\nOver the past couple of summers, I've interned with large corporate companies, only somewhat meaningful to me, but the pay and benefits are incredible. This year I decided to widen my scope and apply to more start ups that I believe in, and I've been offered a position on a team of 12 for a VR startup that is doing pretty well. Not only would I be working in a field I care about, I would also be doing a huge array of things and learning a lot. But to some extent I am concerned about pay. Housing will be covered ($600-$800), and they will roughly double that for all other costs.  \n\nI also have another offer from a huge company with a big name, awesome benefits, and free housing. Has anyone else been in a similar situation, or have any advice? Thanks in advance!",

We'll be going over the basics, and do a few demos -- and it's all online tonight!\n\nhttps://meet.lync.com/stdntpartners/katie.anderson/UFHNU471\n\nAlso, it is in recommended that you do a few things if you wish to follow along or get started doing mobile development with Xamarin.:\n\n1. You need to create your Xamarin account and get your Student License. Go to https://www.xamarin.com/student and follow the on screen instructions. If you already have a dream spark account, you can get started though that, however some students have reported that they get asked for a credit card before completing their sign up. You do not/should not need to enter a credit card to get access to your student license. IF you get asked this, there is another route that you can go. Below the big \"Take me to Microsoft Dream Spark to get started\" button, there is a link that is labeled \"Apply for Xamarin for Students\". This will ask a few basic things like name, Student Email Address, where you are going to school, what country you are in, and a phone number to be reached at. This process takes a few weeks to get your account, but it means no credit card is needed. please try the Dream Spark route first before doing this method due to the short time before the talk.\n\n2. Once you have your account, you will need to set up your environment. Xamarin for Students comes with visual studio integration. however it also has its own stand alone Xamarin Studio which will let you do the exact same things. No matter which path you choose you will need to get your environment installed with the latest mobile SDK's. The installer should do this for you and will walk you though it. If you are stuck or need help, you can look at https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/ which tells you how to get your environment set up. If that does not work, you can reach out to the Midwest's Xamarin MVP at mitchmuenster@gmail.com and he can help you trouble shoot your installation. \n\n3. Finally, you will need to get your phone set up to develop with. \n\nAndroid\nGo to Android Settings / Settings > About Phone \nRepeatedly tap on the section that is titled \"build number\" until you see a message saying \"congrats you are now a developer\"\n\niOS: INPORTANT: you can only develop for iOS if you have a apple desktop or laptop running a non hacked install of OSX. This is an apple mandated thing, you cannot get around it.\nFirst you will have to create your development account. To get started, go to https://developer.apple.com/programs/ and click the blue \"enroll\" button at the top right hand corner.\nPay the $99 USD to activate your apple developer account. There is no \"free\" apple developer program for students\nCreate Provisioning profiles for your accounts for your dev, and production envroments.\nRegister your apple phone or tablet to your developer account, with out doing this you cannot push your app to a iOS device you own.\n\nWindows\nIf you have a dreamspark account you are already most of the way to getting your self set up as a windows phone devloper. to get started follow the guide here https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/alicerp/2013/05/10/students-how-to-set-up-your-free-windows-phone-dev-account-with-dreamspark/",

Providing better access - Many do not have the privilege to have access to education, health or energy. How can we build tools to increase their accessibility? \n3.

The best we can usually hope for is around 10-15 people, including SWE officers. Considering all the hard work that we officers put into planning these events, it's really disheartening to see such low attendance.

And both were in the background or off to the side (see pic). So I decided to check out the VS website and noticed the trend continued. Men outnumbered women on every part of the website with 2 or more people with the sole exception of continuous integration (ps props to who ever designed that page). In fact, most of the time they doubled to quadrupled the number of women. And although there were numerous examples of code commits, only 2 of those were by women. I think that recent GitHub study suggests that number should be way higher. \nAnd its not just a gender issue. Of the 107 people I counted (35 females and 72 men), not a single one had a visible disability. These problems have easy fixes. There could be clip art people in wheel chairs (there is already one on a yoga ball), or with hearing aids, or canes. Or for a start one of the men on the Visual Studio Purchasing Options - Enterprise could be a woman. So I started one of those idea submission things, and if it gets enough votes Microsoft's Visual Studio team will review it. So please vote for this issue: \nhttps://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio-2015/suggestions/12552543-make-visual-studios-website-ux-and-advertising-mor \nI know its just clip art, but they represent what programmers look like and larger systemic issues in engineering. #ILookLikeAnEngineer would not have caught on if it were unnecessary. Women and disabled people already receive many subliminal messages that they don't belong in engineering, the last thing they need is their preferred IDE's website subconsciously saying it too.",

We've grown from 9 girls, to 16, to hopefully 20 next year.\n\nInstead of sending disjointed facebook messages to several people, I wanted to provide a community where we can all talk about the conference and answer questions about getting funded. Attending the conference is an incredible opportunity and personally changed my life (thanks for organizing our first trip Stephanie Hippo). I'll be on here to answer any questions and encourage you to attend GHC  <3",

I personally think it's absolutely ridiculous to expect a candidate to go through a relatively complex system design question without any help, especially in a pressured setting like this.\n\nThe second thing that really pissed me off about this interviewer was his attitude. Normally, I like to illustrate my algorithms before I code to make sure I really understand how to solve the problem. Time was running short, and I was still trying to work out the problem in pictures, and the interviewer literally told me that he \"just wanted to see code on the board.\"  \n\nNot gonna lie, I didn't have an impressive amount of code to show at the end, but seriously, how does he expect for me to \"get code on the board\" when I'm stuck on how to solve the problem fundamentally because he won't give me any damn hints?\n\nI'm so bitter about this. I'm thinking about emailing my recruiter, but I honestly don't think it'll make a difference on whether I'll get an offer.\n\nDoes anyone have advice on what I should do?",

If I'm at a hackathon, I feel naturally a lot more withdrawn or tense and I don't feel as if I can feel comfortable striking up conversations or making connections with other hackers, therefore limiting the experience that I get out of it, which is really disappointing because these side communities outside of school are equally as important to SOME people as actually going to school and getting a degree in terms of opportunities and networking and connections.\n\nLike it's not even like a lot of these communities have overt bro-grammer natures, its just genuinely uncomfortable.

The problem is I have NO idea how to organize anything. We have been able to finagle fundraisers and activities for our women in tech at my university and have had passionate enough few key members who have helped to really drive our projects and workshops, but it's been extremely hard. Most of our members are electronic engineering students.  As a Computer Science major with a concentration in SE, I've been doing my best to learn about electronic engineering so we can work on projects, but making sure that we offer things like interview prep or workshops has been really hard to make sure I can offer the right resources to the right people.I also want to be able to encourage our graphic design majors to join (SERIOUSLY! They are so important and I always want to help them when they say their front end courses are killing them)\n\nUltimately, I would love to have a well functioning machine of women in tech including electronic engineering, computer science, and graphic design majors and also girls just simply interested! The goal would be something like the amazing Tech@NYU (http://techatnyu.org/) I was lucky enough to link off to their page from Terri Burns amazing project on \"The Periodical\".\n\nSo my questions are\n\n- What has been the most effective hierarchical design for ladies that run Women in Tech oriented groups? I want to make sure that members feel ownership of the group, but at the same time, I want to also make sure that it is clear who to refer to on specific issue.\n\n- What have you done to effectively encourage participation in your groups?\n\n- This seems like a very specific question, but has anyone had any kind of way of organizing a social media plan? I think this is very important and something I am horrible at. It's also hard to find the time to when I've had a lot of difficulty delegating responsibilities and been doing a lot of the organization and setting up of events and connections. \n\n- What kinds of workshops or events have you used in your groups that you felt went over well? How did you go about setting them up?\n\n- How do I set up mock interviews with technical companies and make sure I get enough resources for the women in electronic engineering? I am also afraid that our curriculum is extremely outdated. I don't want our girls to get extremely discourages if they are very unprepared for technical interviews.\n\n- How do you gather funding? A lot of the time we want to put on events but do not have the funding. We don't get anything from out CS or Engineering departments, so we'd have to figure out good old fashioned fundraising or have sponsors, which I'm really not sure how to set up. We've done a lot of food related sales, but I'm not sure how effective that is. We have a little over $100 and most of our money goes toward projects. Honestly, I've spent a lot of my own money making sure we have the right resources. (Wires/electronic components for project/Snacks/etc)\n\nI know this is a serious TL;DR, but I would appreciate ANY suggestions.",

Unfortunately I've discovered that art school is a very bad fit for me, both for cultural reasons and health issues (I find art studios much more demanding than even hardcore science classes with heavy labs). \n\nSo I'm looking for a school that's transfer friendly (including on a financial aid level—many schools don't give transfers aid) and also disabled friendly.\n\nBonus points for schools in NYC, LA/S CA, FL and TX. Totally foreign-friendly too, though financial aid is often less.\n\nUSC is currently my first choice, and I've applied there and the top 4 UCs as well.\n\nOh, I'm also mixed white/West Asian/Mexican so I'd prefer a more diverse school and meet some of those diversity quotas. :P\n\nFeel free to throw out some options or suggestions. :) Thanks!\n\nOh and edited to add that while \"prestige\" is nice, I'm looking more for cultural fit and a place where I can be happy and grow.",

I like java and I am getting better but sometimes I feel like I am not good enough than what some other people can do. It scares me so much that Im even terrified to graduate to see what I'm going to do.\n    I had some minor difficulties last semester with my classes but I got out of academic probation. So I want to join Hackathons but do they look at GPA? Or even find a internship  with the same issue? Mine is a 2.0 but I get so anxious looking for jobs / activities that can help me become more confident. Do you guys maybe have some tips on what I can do to maybe feel more at ease? Or even stories you'd like to share if you had a similar issue? My dream job is to become a Game Programmer. But to get started I wanted to work on app development for now. Thanks so much!",

Anybody can attend, and we encourage beginners and first time hackathoners to come! Our goal is to create a fun, low-stress environment where students can make new friends, learn about new tech, and hopefully build something they're really passionate about.\n\nThe hackathon is Nov. 14 - 15 in the Shapiro Science Center at Brandeis University in Waltham, MA. Unfortunately we won't be able to provide travel reimbursements, but Waltham is super easily accessible by bus and commuter rail from Boston.

I have stopped using colored fonts and only have one image per email and still this issue persists with my mailchimp account.\n\nIn edition to this, I had a \"Message bounced due to Bulk Sender\" issue when I attempted to send a BCC email to over 100 people. Another regular non-bcc returned 90 times that \"Message [was] rejected.\"\n\nAt this point I will do anything to get out the spam box! Even leave mailchimp... But I am trying to keep the same \"from\" email because it matches my orgs name..\n\nAny advice/tips will be approached. I am on the verge of creating a google group just for mass emails..

Plenty of people make huge gaffes but mean well, and while sometimes people are just jerks, the most productive thing to do when you are slighted due to sex or gender is educate. Explain why what they've said or done was foolish or derogatory, and the likeliest thing is they will be embarrassed and change their behavior in the future. I know I'm preaching, but I really feel this is the surest way to turn more passive bystanders into active allies in the tech community, and I want to bring it to the forefront of our minds again.",

I've only started to code last year and the people of LSH have been one of my main inspirations to keep pushing and learning so THANK YOU! I'm absolutely blown away by how supportive this community is and I can't wait to give back. Fan-girling aside, I was wondering if any LSH-ers in the Bay Area would be down to meet up with me anytime between the 19th-23rd? I'll be right between China Town and the Financial District, and would LOVE LOVE LOVE if I could meet any of you (maybe at HackCon, for some short company or even over lunch/dinner/breakfast because food = <3 hehe!) If anyone is interested in meeting up with me I'd be super excited to meet you. Feel free to comment or personal message me if you'd want to meet up at either HackCon or elsewhere during that time; I'd be the happiest girl in the world :D! Oh, and comments/suggestions on cool places to visit/explore in the area are also welcome as it will be my first time there!

We'll have Springboard Projects to get new hackers (and those interested in learning a new skill) started building from Hour 1, and a great team of mentors to help you develop your ideas and debug. If that doesn't convince you, Saturday night is Chipotle night! We hope to see you there. Feel free to email team@unhackathon.org, message Unhackathon or comment with any questions. \n\nWe feel especially close to this group since we hosted I think the very first LSH Meetup last year!

Cute shapes + interactivity means that people who aren't necessarily going to read about social justice issues might at least have some of their notions challenged.\n\nThe TL;DR is that even if individuals \"don't mind\" living in a diverse area, if they are afraid to be in the minority and don't make an *active effort* to diversify, the overall society will become segregated.\n\nAnother phenomenon that might work well in a simulator like this is the effect explained here: http://iangent.blogspot.com/2013/10/the-petrie-multiplier-why-attack-on.html possibly withe the inclusion of the pipeline problem as well (e.g. everyone starts with some amount of self-confidence, drops by delta every time they have a biased experience, quit when no more self-confidence. They are then replaced randomly from a pipeline which is not representative, simulation continues.) My thought is that we would see diversity decrease unless there were special efforts made to help under-represented populations. Might help some people see that \"reverse discrimination\" doesn't actually give an *unfair* advantage to a minority population?",

I was thinking of phrasing it such that people would say yes if they felt like they could see themselves in media, in however their identity feels to them. Any ideas on ways to phrase these questions? \n\n#2: A lot of people find the negations confusing.\nRight now answering 'yes' always means (though of course it's not this black and white) that you had this kind of privilege - which is why there's the negations. \n- Do you think that's a good visual for consistency? \n- Is there another way to word the questions to get the same answers, but less confusing?\n- Would having yes/no always mean the same thing kind of allow people to not think about the answer? (people could start associating one with \"good\" and the other with \"bad\" and potentially biasing the rest of their answers)\n\nAlso any other feedback is very welcome! I want to make this awesome and helpful. Thanks <3",

Here's an interview with Ways We Work to answer those questions: bit.ly/1Rtmv9L. \n\nLess about the article. Two main takeaways from being interviewed:\n\n(1) I realized that I'm terrible at story telling. I want to build my personal brand so I look for a platform (Medium/Twitter/Facebook/personal blog/another website..etc) and use it to help me build MY brand (in this case, my brand = Li Chen).\n\n(2) I cold emailed the founder of Ways We Work and pitched myself. No connections. No referrals. YOU ARE YOUR OWN PR. I was hesitant at first to email her (imposter syndrome?) but I'm glad I did. \n\nAs you're looking for internships/jobs or starting an entry level, I hope you start thinking/crafting/telling your story. It's definitely a plus. \n\nShared with love,\n\nLi",

I've always thought it was awesome but lacked the discipline to teach myself, so I'm really interested in Girls Who Code and any other summer programs that anyone has to suggest.\n\nI'm not really looking for a camp that's all about \"look how cool cs is, you should consider it\" because I've been exposed to engineering and very basic cs; I just want to delve deeper. I'm looking for something that will be fun in addition to technically challenging. I'm not entirely sure if GWC fits that description. Does anyone know more about the program? Or if there are other programs you know of that sound like they would be appropriate, it would be amazing to let me know.\n\nAs a side note, I'm also interested anything related to building computers or just hardware/engineering/physics in general too.

As an aside, you should all follow that page and apply for their hackathon next year - it was a great one.\n\nWe hacked together a browser extension that semantically analyzes the news articles you read, and shows you articles about the same story that were written from different perspectives. This helps you explore the many different sides to each news story, and be more informed about all the issues surrounding newsworthy events.\n\nWe were really excited by the resulting project and the response we got (lots of chatter and 1st grand prize, \"Most innovative\"). Now we're gunning for the People's Choice award  - if you think our project sounds cool, we would really appreciate a vote! Voting goes until Thurs at 10:45pm EST.\n\nWe're also working to get a beta version released on the Chrome store, and would love help integrating with more news APIs. If you're interested in helping out, let me know! Open source projects ftw.\n\n~~~Helpful voting instructions by Jackie:\n1. Go to the project page at http://canvas.challengepost.com/submissions/30689-perspectives\n2. Click the yellow \"Vote\" button.\n3. Follow the instructions to create a Challengepost account (if you don't already have one). You can delete this later - it's harmless and they won't send you spam.\n\nThank you!",

This is why.\n\nGrace Hopper *charges* its speakers to attend. Yes, that's right. You get accepted to attend -- and then they make you buy a ticket. To do your own talk. I believe they offer speakers a discount, but still.\n\nThis is not normal. I've never seen a conference charge its own speakers. In fact, most conferences I see pay for speakers travel as well. But, at the very minimum, you get a free ticket (and often one for a colleague/friend too).\n\nBy charging the speakers, GHC sends a message that the speakers are not valued. It also creates issues where speakers who are cash-tight can't give their own talk.\n\nI've seen bits of conversation here and there about this policy (finally!) and I think it'd be well worth it to start a petition about this. I don't have the time to lead this right now and I think it'd be a good opportunity for someone else anyway. I'd be the first to sign though and I'd help a bit with some social media love.\n\nSo... anyone want to start a petition?",

This nine-month fellowship begins September 1, 2016, and will give young entrepreneurs the chance to get their foot in the door in high growth startups in the True portfolio. While this program will be open to all recent graduates, we are acutely aware of the challenges faced by women of all ages interested in breaking into the startup world and we hope and expect that at least half of our Fellows will be women. Fellows will work full-time with True portfolio companies in areas including engineering, business development, customer success, product and more. Additionally, the group will gather periodically with the True Ventures team and participate in annual True network events to develop a broader perspective on the venture capital process and the Bay Area startup ecosystem.\n \nPriya Haji Fellows receive a monthly stipend of $5,000. The program’s application deadline is January 31, 2016. For more information, please visit www.trueventures.com/PHF or email PHF@trueventures.com.",

Deals don't typically expire (check for \"Lifetime Access\" under the \"Includes\" section on each course's page), offer lifetime access to updates and changes, and if \"Certificate of Completion\" is listed in there as well... you'll have a certificate to show your employer!\n\nJust use the link below to apply the promo code/see the amount of time left in the promo.

My instinct tells me not to waste their time but I've never been in this situation before. Any thoughts?",

This is normally listed in the group description, but that doesn't always get read. So this is me amplifying the resources we have available to help amplify you.\n\nSlack channel. If you don't know what Slack is, it's basically a group chat. (learn more at slack.com) You can sign up for our Slack by referencing the post below. Use it to discuss anything you want or chat with others for help. Need to vent about an interview you're worried about or something at the office that maybe pissed you off/discouraged you/or made you uncomfortable? We gotchu. Need to help with a technical topic and need to talk through the problem with someone? We gotchu. Trying to find someone who interviewed at the same place you did or maybe already works there? We gotchu too. Want to share something cool you helped build or write or organize? We so gotchu. Possibilities so endless. \n\nMedium Collection. (https://medium.com/ladies-storm-hackathons) Don't wait for someone else to write your story. Submit technical blog posts, tech opinion pieces, post-mortems from hackathon--- whatever you want. Read what other women are writing. Help amplify them on social media. Recommend each other's stories.\n\nTwitter: @TheLSHStorm. Tweet us when you want us to share something you did. Follow us to hear what other women are doing. We tweet resources for women in tech (scholarships for schools and conferences) and general Women in Tech interest. We love amplifying members, so shoot us an @. \n\nGitHub: (https://github.com/Ladies-Storm-Hackathons) We collect resources to help you in classes and have bounced around a few other projects. Think we're missing something? Submit a PR. We collectively own this, and if you found a resource helpful, chances are someone else will too.\n\nLSH Jobs and Internships: (https://www.facebook.com/groups/LSHJobs/) Subgroup for job-specific stuff. \n\nMeetups: Going to a hackathon or conference? See if there's an LSH meetup scheduled. If not, gauge interest and start the event yourself. \n\nI'm probably forgetting something, so if any LSHers think of anything, add it here.",

But from the few opportunities I've had to attend such things, I've found them incredibly valuable.\n\nAt the same time, I've worked hard to secure and work my ass off at paid internships to be able to support the life I am living. So in theory, the money is in my bank account, so I feel that someone who genuinely doesn't have the money should receive a scholarship instead.\n\nAt the same time, I definitely would not feel justified paying that amount at the moment and would not go to the event at all in that case, which defeats the point of the scholarship existing in the first place.\n\nAny thoughts?",

It's fine if it's done right, but there have been a lot of people with whom I had issues. I have received resumes linked from several different sites that wanted me to create an account in order to view their resume.  And then there's Google Drive, in which case they \"attach\" the file but when I click it, I am told I need to request permission from the file's owner.  Again, hoops to jump through - not good!  So make sure that if you're sending your resume out in a less common format, you know exactly what your potential employer will see, and what they will need to do to see it!",

What kinds of things can a first-timer expect?\n2. What have other people's experiences been like attending GHC?\n3. If you also went by yourself, how did you go about meeting people and making friends?\n\nAlso, if anyone has any ideas - what's the best way to find housing + transportation at this point since all nearby hotels are booked?

This is... decent, but we definitely definitely definitely want more girls to come out.\n\nThis is the first big hackathon that Lansing will see and since it's literally in the capital of Michigan, I really want there to be a big ladies presence. MythicApps is part of the Capital Tech Initiative and if we can get a lot of women at the event, we'll not only be making a statement about Lansing's quickly-growing tech scene, but also about women's interest in the tech scene! \n\nThank you to LSH for existing. It's really inspiring to girls like me who want to build and inspire other girls. Because I've been successful and supported by a great community of women in tech, my little sister (10th grade) is taking all the CS courses she can in high school and learning HTML/CSS/JS from General Assembly. She's also coming to MythicApps to learn more this September. \n\nAnyways, you all rock. <3 Thanks.\n\nhttps://www.mythicapps.io",

With a group of volunteers, I taught game design (Scratch), app development (MIT AppInventor), robotics (Finch), and web development (HTML/CSS). On the last day, we traveled to Ann Arbor (Michigan) to visit the engineering campus of the University of Michigan and Google Ann Arbor. \n\nAnyways, I submitted this initiative in Microsoft's Youthspark Challenge for Change competition, and somehow, I'm one of the 15 finalists for the 13-17 age group out of thousands of other applicants! To go the next round, it's all voting-based, and it literally just takes a minute to vote. Just go bit.do/voteTina, click my face, and type in your email. You can vote once every day from May 7, 2015-May 14, 2015, and it would mean the world to me if you all can vote for me! If you want a daily reminder to vote (like I said, it literally takes less than a minute), you can subscribe here: http://eepurl.com/bmijX9.  The prize is a $2500 grant (among other things) for the program, which I'd love to use to host another field trip to a tech office nearby. You can get more information about my program on tina98.github.io/HelloWorld/, or just read the description/watch my video on bit.do/voteTina. \n\nThank you so much for everything ❤",

I'm fairly new to this group, but I saw Amy's post a few days ago and I also just wrote an article on a similar topic (in my case it's VERY school-specific, I go to a gov/econ focused college that's literally across the street from an engineering college). But, the gist of it is that it encourages participation in tech for those who are late in the game/haven't been programming since age 2. What do you guys think? I know there are tons of ways to go about it, but how do you engage atypical CS students? \n\nAlso, here's my article in case anyone wants a read, I would love some feedback. http://claremontindependent.com/civilization-prospers-with-computer-science/ (the title is a modification of my school's motto)",

So we’re planning to host a 48 hour hackathon on a cruise ship some time next year in May or June for 4 days leaving from either Southern California or from Miami (we’ll confirm later). We just wanted to see how many of you would be interested. Our target audience is college students, grad students and professionals. You would probably only have to pay a small participation fee of $300-$400 to cover rooms on board, free food on board, wifi, exclusive access to the amenities like the pools, gaming casinos, etc. Right now, travel reimbursements would not be available, but if we get enough sponsors, this could definitely be possible! Please fill out this survey if you have the time:\n\nhttps://summithacks.typeform.com/to/D6EqvA\n\n…and if not, just like and comment! \nWe’d really love your feedback!",

We're mainly focused on education (although there is a competitive aspect), so we really try to encourage beginners to participate, and one of our main focuses is having a balanced gender ratio (the other is reaching out to low income students who often don't have access to tech resources).\n\nThis is a pretty shameless ask but we'd love to get your helping to spread the word (ie over twitter, facebook, etc [or even organizing an event at your school!]). The reason I think this would be helpful is because your friends who are still in high school will see the message about getting involved in tech coming from a respected role model and feel more comfortable in attending. The other reason is that we're also trying to have a balanced mentor and judge gender ratio, so that attendees meet women they can look up to and keep in touch with, and you all have great networks of women who might be excited about getting involved. Hopefully this is pretty inline with the mission of the group and a cause that you all are passionate about. If you do tweet about it please avoid the word \"hackathon\" though, since we've noticed it scares a lot of beginners away.\n\nWould be happy to discuss more in the comments. Let me know what you all think!",

I'm curious if you all ever encountered times when you're interviewing with companies for internships/jobs and then you get the position, but then you also know a number of guys who interviewed for the same thing and didn't. Is there a lot of negativity around that for you? I use to think there wasn't, but last year a friend told me about how someone did talk about how I got an internship offer just because I am a girl. How do you deal with that? And how do you internally deal with the fact that sometimes a guy (whose skills you really think are better than yours) doesn't get a position you did?",
