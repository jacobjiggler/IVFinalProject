[02:22] <astutefig76> wow he knife his teammate during warmup report for grief
[02:22] <therealmaker> i dont know if i can trust anybody after this
[02:22] <mattthecruelts> Dude you need to become self-aware and understand the fact that live wants you to have a partner so your children can make children and so on, don't give a god damn shit about the system and start playing by your own rules
[02:22] <konjkave> Lol
[02:22] <mrnarcissus> @therealmaker i'm not saying you should get a new gf
[02:22] <kodaly> 100% hacker
[02:22] <konjkave> Not hacking at all
[02:22] <astutefig76> i have legit no idea what you just said @Mattthecruelts
[02:22] <konjkave> 100% legit
[02:23] <head_wound_city> this guy is terrible, his opponents were just that much worse
[02:23] <mom0momo> HeyGuys
[02:23] <shadowtemple> lol checking lower isn't hacking xD
[02:23] <zagameris> no hacks he just dmg destiny mg 1 so yea...
[02:23] <konjkave> MOMO? Couldn't sleep?
[02:23] <mom0momo> I just woken up from a power nap
[02:23] <astutefig76> this is a very good player right here
[02:23] <mindofakid> lol
[02:23] <mom0momo> I had a dream
[02:23] <arcanicst> badges arent that particularly good but sure they rape mg1 ez
[02:23] <alientree> they won the first three rounds in a row before this guy started going off
[02:23] <mom0momo> that Hillary Clinton was a witch
[02:23] <unfortunatexbl> He's legit lmao. You guys are so dumb if you think he's hacking ... He checked car when no one was there he's just a good player on a smurf
[02:23] <6hayden9> momo do u like One Piece? or is it not edgy enough
[02:23] <konjkave> OH you know, he can just ssee the enemy through the wall and knows EXACTLY how to approach
[02:23] <mom0momo> during the final debate
[02:23] <dallery131> is a 10 minute nap a power nap now?
[02:23] <konjkave> Not hacking
[02:23] <astutefig76> she already is @Mom0momo
[02:23] <nateraegu> implying there is a huge difference between dmg and mg2
[02:23] <sykoo> Well, he was dmg, while everyone on on the other team was MG and MG2
[02:23] <mom0momo> But she admitted it
[02:23] <josto_gibta> MoM0MoMo, That is just reality. You are seeing into the future
[02:23] <mom0momo> :O
[02:24] <enetolive> !momolewds
[02:24] <pianoconspiracy> Allentree, so basically, he got tired of losign and turned on his hax
[02:24] <alientree> i wouldn't doubt it, but we have to see for ourselves
[02:24] <kodaly> This is some Athens shit, just playing a demo
[02:24] <therealmaker> do u think ,pretend that i dont care, and just play games would help? i ditched so many friends for her
[02:24] <kodaly> Athene*
[02:24] <alientree> i won't be surprised if the first three rounds are all trash-tier play though
[02:24] <astutefig76> @Kodaly like a kaceytron stream
[02:24] <mom0momo> Why is Destiny picking on Athene anyways?
[02:24] <alientree> which is fishy enough for someone who ends the match with 51 kills
[02:24] <sykoo> Destiny is BRBing, so he put up something we could watch while hes gone
[02:24] <mom0momo> What did he ever do to him?
[02:24] <6hayden9> Mom0momo do u like One Piece? or is it not edgy enough
[02:24] <oldirtywhiteman> destiny trying out for g4g
[02:24] <konjkave> I gave you the answer in a whisper therealmaker, you need to learn to move on or you will suffer forever
[02:25] <mom0momo> 6hayden9 too many eps
[02:25] <nateraegu> he used an awp and people ran into him 1 at a time, hes nothing special
[02:25] <alientree> everyone remember the guy we're watching the POV of right now ends this match 51-12
[02:25] <kodaly> At least mace actually plays the game... @astutefig76
[02:25] <mom0momo> I only watch animes with < 24eps per season
[02:25] <konjkave> Either delete and remove everything of her from your life, or find someone to replace her
[02:25] <kodaly> Kaceytron*
[02:25] <astutefig76> ?
[02:25] <walking_wounded> lol that repeak
[02:25] <astutefig76> oh
[02:25] <konjkave> There are no other choices
[02:25] <astutefig76> lol

[02:28] <thaonliwun> tfe
[02:28] <thaonliwun> tfw
[02:28] <kmckia> that play where he guarded ct
[02:28] <nateraegu> ye thats because hes bad not because hes walling
[02:28] <charisma96> LOL
[02:28] <astutefig76> him running into b with a pistol was because they new where everyone was already
[02:28] <kmckia> and instantly went long
[02:28] <konjkave> He could have defused it =(
[02:29] <nighthawk420> im confused, is destiny on the other team?
[02:29] <nateraegu> yes
[02:29] <thaonliwun> yed

[02:30] <konjkave> @Mom0momo OuO

[02:30] <footcleanz> in this thread
[02:30] <shadowtemple> in this thread? I think
[02:30] <astutefig76> ive heard it before just never looked into it
[02:30] <cptprairiedog> no cam?
[02:30] <konjkave> !momohentai
[02:30] <astutefig76> oh
[02:30] <dasaucebaus> mom0momo sorry I stick to the OG bible black
[02:30] <blastbullx> @destiny this is csgo not destiny
[02:30] <konjkave> Did you dream about MoM0
[02:30] <shadowtemple> wow walls
[02:30] <shadowtemple> that was way to obvious lol
[02:30] <konjkave> it*
[02:31] <astutefig76> no shit retard @Blastbullx
[02:31] <nateraegu> he gets most of his kills on CT when he just sat mid with an awp and people just kept trying to challenge him 1 at a time with no flashes or smokes
[02:31] <berkoklu> wow
[02:31] <johua986> He is just really really REALLY lucky guys. Just because he frags alot does not mean he hacks. BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[02:31] <kmckia> no way he heard that lols
[02:31] <shadowtemple> he just looks lower sees 3 through the wall long and rushes back to t spawn to engage
[02:31] <creativityfails> awkward hover through walls
[02:31] <athasus> who's this guy?
[02:31] <mom0momo> Konjkave no it's real
[02:31] <astutefig76> @Shadowtemple what rank are you?
[02:31] <mom0momo> wanna know the Artist's name?
[02:31] <alientree> @Athasus guy on the other team in destiny's last game who got 51 kills
[02:31] <konjkave> Yeah sure why nawt
[02:31] <alientree> we're watching the replay while he gets food
[02:31] <unfortunatexbl> If you went in not expecting a hacker watching this you wouldn't think he's hacking you have a preconceived bias already established
[02:32] <brock4ever> @Athasus Destiny joined athene's gamingforgood network and now is adopting the same method of spectating games rather than playing them
[02:32] <itsjustcrow> MingLee MingLee
[02:32] <johua986> fag
[02:32] <1800crymoare> he isnt playing is he? im so confused at what he's doing
[02:32] <oldirtywhiteman> wtf
[02:32] <alientree> @1800crymoare he's gone getting food, this is a match he just finished
[02:32] <1800crymoare> thanks
[02:32] <nateraegu> hes watching a demo of the game he just played
[02:32] <1800crymoare> i thought that might have been it
[02:33] <creativityfails> was he just placing his crosshair on the wall again
[02:33] <nateraegu> he has the crosshair placement of a gold
[02:33] <athasus> @Brock4ever and bots too?
[02:33] <cheesuscrust666> murica
[02:33] <smekzor> We are just spectating like Athene Kappa
[02:33] <brock4ever> @Athasus yes bots too, look how slow the chat is
[02:33] <brock4ever> Im a bot
[02:33] <qualitybad> this guy looks at the floor and buys tec9 on buy rounds ok then
[02:34] <crazyagaa> whhat i wanted to see stardew valley
[02:34] <crazyagaa> i dont care about counterstrike
[02:34] <crazyagaa> :c
[02:34] <cowtell> :c
[02:34] <angrytowely> :c
[02:34] <tatami2> :c
[02:34] <creativityfails> :c
[02:34] <cheesuscrust666> cs is gay tarded
[02:34] <mom0momo> Destiny have you seen this before? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mt3M2P7qHA
[02:34] <kmckia> no way lols
[02:34] <alientree> were those shots legit? i have no way to gauge that reaction time since i don't actually play
[02:34] <oldirtywhiteman> was the ct with the nade running?
[02:35] <nowandthen420> this guy is def hacking right? no way he could be better than destiny?
[02:35] <tatami2> yeah
[02:35] <nateraegu> well the 1st shot is a common spot
[02:35] <hellboy267> Where did senpai go?
[02:35] <nateraegu> the 2nd im assuming he heard the guy
[02:35] <kmckia> the 2nd peek was weird tho
[02:35] <brock4ever> he is getting hot chocolate and a bj
[02:35] <alientree> kk
[02:35] <hellboy267> oh nice
[02:35] <kmckia> yeah no way
[02:35] <reveshi> okay this guy has walls 100%
[02:36] <paranienoidalny> never check car :/
[02:36] <1800crymoare> yeah
[02:36] <nateraegu> ye he might actually
[02:36] <docjdaws90> ANELE
[02:36] <1800crymoare> no he has walls 100%
[02:36] <qualitybad> hes cheating
[02:36] <kmckia> reportt
[02:36] <konjkave> He is snapping to body pretty easily
[02:36] <1800crymoare> the snapping is easy....
[02:36] <cheesuscrust666> what kind of perks does he have? juggernoob?
[02:36] <alientree> hahaha as soon as nate starts to think so, now i'm giving the theory some credit
[02:36] <crackhead000111> walling so hard
[02:36] <reveshi> yeah seems like aim assists 2
[02:36] <cowtell> is he just letting himself die at times then to make it seem like he doesnt wall?
[02:36] <nateraegu> ye ive changed my mind
[02:36] <1800crymoare> he watches the angle where someone is at all the time
[02:36] <nateraegu> these last few rounds have been dodgy as fuck
[02:36] <1800crymoare> and when he killed the guy from t spawn last time
[02:36] <kazmcdemon> Wait I just got back, is this guy streaming? And destiny is streaming his stream?
[02:37] <rhanza> aim at a wall
[02:37] <alientree> @Cowtell his play almost feels like he turns it on and off
[02:37] <rhanza> rofl
[02:37] <oldirtywhiteman> lmao
[02:37] <1800crymoare> when the teammate came to get his gun
[02:37] <konjkave> I just don't get why he keeps resting his crosshair on the edge of the door
[02:37] <cowtell> ah
[02:37] <1800crymoare> he shot at the middle of the wall
[02:37] <oldirtywhiteman> DuckerZ GabeN
[02:37] <berkoklu> fuck off
[02:37] <konjkave> Dude what was that shot?
[02:37] <kmckia> lols it's getting sketchier
[02:37] <berkoklu> he is hack obviously
[02:37] <shadowtemple> @Kazmcdemon destiny getting food this is just for entertainment watching the possible hacker from last game
[02:37] <reveshi> Cowtell prob toggle off to make it less obvious and when he is winning without it
[02:37] <kazmcdemon> Oh it's the game match
[02:37] <konjkave> Instant OP he fired before he even scoped
[02:37] <konjkave> AWP*
[02:37] <1800crymoare> he's for sure toggling
[02:37] <qualitybad> hr has the movement of a silver
[02:37] <nateraegu> ye his gameplay is of a silver
[02:37] <alientree> but then he does stuff like that... where he misses someone that was actually in his line of sight lmao
[02:37] <shandim002> his awareness is shit but he lands weird shots, i'd say cheating
[02:38] <nateraegu> movement/crosshair placement are all that of a silver/nova tbh

[02:43] <teimuh> because ure sens is retarded high
[02:44] <1800crymoare> because your sense is so high
[02:44] <1800crymoare> ^
[02:44] <astutefig76> probably
[02:44] <1800crymoare> no, thats what it is
[02:44] <nateraegu> 400 dps 1.8 ingame
[02:44] <1800crymoare> not probably
[02:44] <astutefig76> im just used to it now
[02:44] <nateraegu> dpi
[02:44] <teimuh> try 400 dpi with 2~4
[02:44] <oldirtywhiteman> you can probably 1080 with that sens and dpi
[02:44] <astutefig76> loool
[02:44] <arcanicst> he's not cheating man
[02:44] <niemanntv> you are eating those fries in a very suspicious way
[02:44] <astutefig76> its really hard to say if hes cheating or not
[02:44] <tatami2> can I be your fetus
[02:44] <teimuh> like if you play quake or arena shoters play with 4 ~ 5 if you play cs and you wanna be good start at 2 and work ur way up till you go as fast as you can while being acurate
[02:44] <hyster1x> doesnt even slowly check guy on cat to see if hes pushed, just straight up looks towards boxes
[02:44] <1800crymoare> its really not hard
[02:45] <lizardwrath> thinking about killing myself, any tips?
[02:45] <iamdreamwing> DestinyWheresByron?
[02:45] <nateraegu> the ct side is dodgier
[02:45] <1800crymoare> @lizardwrath, kill someone else before you do it
[02:45] <mutednogard> lizardwrath stream it FeelsGoodMan
[02:45] <astutefig76> @Lizardwrath shoot self off of a high place
[02:45] <nateraegu> he has 160hours on that account
[02:45] <1800crymoare> @lizardwrath, i suggest a unique poison
[02:45] <teimuh> in eu lems ez drop 50 in mg
[02:45] <lizardwrath> you guys are alright. dont go to nebraska tomorrow
[02:45] <teimuh> mg players dont have basic understanding
[02:45] <walking_wounded> Im an LEM and im pretty sure ive never dropped a 50
[02:46] <walking_wounded> he's gotta be sandbagging
[02:46] <madc0zbad> CESEGO
[02:46] <walking_wounded> and deranked maybe
[02:46] <midnight_ahri> you guys are alright. dont go to twitch chat tomorrow
[02:46] <codan1990> are you gonna shoot up all of nebraska?
[02:46] <voltz_starcraft> maybe he just knows his sprays
[02:46] <drewluuu> hey thats my friend
[02:46] <codan1990> id like to see that
[02:46] <astutefig76> i think the highest ive dropped ever was a 40 something bomb
[02:46] <astutefig76> probably toggling
[02:46] <teimuh> for everyone that has like 2~4k hours in cs everything below smfc in mm is like dm with bad bots
[02:46] <mom0momo> Does Destiny think this guy is hacking
[02:46] <nateraegu> he toggles for sure when he has an awp
[02:47] <hawlk> looks like hes walling
[02:47] <mom0momo> I dont think he is
[02:47] <midnight_ahri> is dat u nate
[02:47] <dantrogaming> oh my god i want mcdonalds
[02:47] <drewluuu> hes clean 100% i play w him all the time
[02:47] <crackhead000111> yes momo, now deliver the goods a OuO
[02:47] <shandim002> he's too trash to be smurfing
[02:47] <creativityfails> But they stopped doing 2 for 2 :[
[02:47] <1800crymoare> On B site one time 3 cts and he ONLY looked anywhere when someone was coming through that exact entrance at that time
[02:47] <nateraegu> ye hes garbage, hes not smurfing
[02:47] <alientree> yeah, it's clearly not a smurf
[02:47] <1800crymoare> and had no sound of them coming
[02:47] <teimuh> lol ppl
[02:47] <bobocs> also he always knows when a flash is coming.
[02:47] <teimuh> he can smurf maybe hes le on his main
[02:47] <dragonxdog> how do you get the fps on the screen?
[02:47] <lizardwrath> he was DMG btw
[02:47] <nateraegu> net_graph 1
[02:47] <kmckia> he also doesn't nade pure aim
[02:48] <leiskaaa> with that crosshair placement, not a smurf.
[02:48] <1800crymoare> cl_showfps 1
[02:48] <shandim002> LE wont get 51 kills 3 ranks below their normal rank
[02:48] <destiny_bot> Destiny updates YouTube regularly now! "Common Core (and Trump)" posted 11h 48m ago youtu.be/STCAQmFGcww
[02:48] <1800crymoare> works also
[02:48] <tatami2> >thinking someone is hacking because they can hear a flashbang hitting the ground
[02:48] <teimuh> lol
[02:48] <1800crymoare> something like that
[02:48] <1800crymoare> He didnt even look left
[02:48] <1800crymoare> straight down to tuns
[02:48] <teimuh> thats how you push cat
[02:48] <teimuh> man xD
[02:48] <1800crymoare> yeah, with hacks...
[02:48] <deadlysnowcone> Destiny, not saying he's not hacking but he was DMG and old supreme/globals got deranked to DMG. That being said his movement looks like a gold nova.
[02:48] <oldirtywhiteman> no flashes
[02:48] <leiskaaa> there was guy at mid looking at upper mid
[02:49] <namelanator> doesnt look like a cheater to me
[02:49] <leiskaaa> ct*
[02:49] <teimuh> nah with brain you smoke stairs and watch lower
[02:49] <teimuh> also you guys act like mg is like saying that these players are any good
[02:49] <tr0ubl3> this guy is 100% not cheating
[02:49] <lizardwrath> why the fuck are crunchwraps a breakfast only thing fucking idiots
[02:49] <friendlyspartan> he isnt hacking dumb kids
[02:50] <1800crymoare> do you mean snackwraps
[02:50] <lizardwrath> no steak crunchwraps
[02:50] <bobocs> lol he has the most retarded crosshair placement on top of his ridiculous plays
[02:50] <nateraegu> mfw watch 1 round and say hes not hacking
[02:50] <angrytowely> !trade
[02:50] <alientree> @Nateraegu ikr
[02:50] <angrytowely> wats that trade link breh
[02:50] <1800crymoare> description reading OP
[02:50] <friendlyspartan> he checks in the right places and has decent aim nothing special there
[02:50] <1800crymoare> rip nvm
[02:51] <alientree> oh yeah, no, i've never seen him flash even
[02:51] <tatami2> Gottta save for that awp huh
[02:51] <drewluuu> hes DMG i play w him hes clean
[02:51] <teimuh> because buying nades vs mgs is unfair LOL
[02:51] <tcmbrokenbutt> What is Destiny doing?
[02:51] <shandim002> we can tell he's dmg lol, but how do u know hes clean for sure
[02:51] <bobocs> its possible to smurf and do this well, but you can tell the way he places his crosshair and you can see his lack of game sense
[02:51] <1800crymoare> lets all focus on the real thing here
[02:51] <qualitybad> watching this guy is giving me a brain tumor
[02:51] <paranienoidalny> well, his movement is far far away from dmg, but he somehow hits that shots
[02:51] <1800crymoare> Destiny has an SG
[02:51] <twick2gee> SEEMS LEGIT
[02:52] <twick2gee> >.>
[02:52] <oldirtywhiteman> wtf was that lmao
[02:52] <sykoo> Is it me, or does that look like A LOT of sense? his mouse is just moving so much while scoped.
[02:52] <sykoo> like, instead of small movements, its like, inches
[02:52] <konjkave> I think he toggles his hacks
[02:52] <teimuh> you gotta remember its 16 tick demo
[02:52] <crackhead000111> lol wut
[02:52] <bobocs> look he just tried to look away from that nade thinking it was a flash
[02:52] <hawlk> hes walling 100 percent
[02:52] <nateraegu> 32 tick demo
[02:52] <deadlysnowcone> destiny shift + f2
[02:52] <drewluuu> no walls either
[02:52] <tatami2> lower tickrate replays
[02:52] <teimuh> or 32 it still looks like shit
[02:52] <deadlysnowcone> oh nvm you got it
[02:53] <dantrogaming> some kind of cheating
[02:53] <sykoo> shift+F2, or F1 or something
[02:53] <sizickness> maybe he just had a good game
[02:53] <walking_wounded> CS GO replay is fucking aids
[02:53] <teimuh> how much hours have the guys that call cheats on him
[02:53] <midnight_ahri> LUL
[02:53] <tatami2> Hours dont mean shit
[02:53] <cheesuscrust666> uninstall
[02:53] <drewluuu> hes clean irl seen him play ez
[02:53] <sur_vivor> at least they have replays
[02:53] <teimuh> hours are everything
[02:53] <1800crymoare> School in 5 hours D;
[02:53] <teimuh> if you have 4k dm hours
[02:53] <walking_wounded> What round are we on? 21? >goes to round 26 lmao
[02:53] <teimuh> ure a god
[02:54] <tatami2> I've seen 4k hour mgs or silvers dawg
[02:54] <oldirtywhiteman> because they dont play to get better
[02:54] <bobocs> the guy is for sure cheating, he constantly takes glances through walls, when it doesn't even make sense to look there.
[02:54] <teimuh> yeah but did they play 4 k hours of d2 with not trying to get better
[02:54] <oldirtywhiteman> they just play mods
[02:54] <mom0momo> How does Donald Trump plan on solving our immigration problem?
[02:54] <reveshi> im just a eu 450 hours legendary eagle BibleThump
[02:54] <tatami2> SLOWMO
[02:54] <teimuh> 450 le is good
[02:54] <thaonliwun> LOL
[02:54] <lizardwrath> SwiftRage
[02:54] <dycee> LOL
[02:54] <nateraegu> rofl
[02:55] <sykoo> Yeah, that wasnt smoked
[02:55] <shadowtemple> LOL
[02:55] <quitelife> Seems legit
[02:55] <sykoo> was it?
[02:55] <shadowtemple> ya
[02:55] <papermashy> through smoke?
[02:55] <tcmbrokenbutt> No
[02:55] <konjkave> NOT HACKING 100% MASTER SNIPER SEES THROUGH SMOKE
[02:55] <creativityfails> there wasnt a smoke there though :c
[02:55] <br0metheus> lol
[02:55] <shadowtemple> that's the hacks m8
[02:55] <oldirtywhiteman> that was a bug
[02:55] <astutefig76> hes so inconsistent its weird
[02:55] <teimuh> sure he is
[02:55] <teimuh> because its low lvl mm
[02:55] <teimuh> wtf do you expect
[02:56] <bobocs> you can tell just by his movement, crosshairplacement, and inconsistency, that theres no way he would be a someone who drops 30 in a half
[02:56] <lizardwrath> not hacks
[02:56] <teimuh> bobo look at all players in this game they have probaly worse mechanics at all
[02:56] <crackhead000111> just a wall bang, do you even cs 1.6
[02:56] <bobocs> and on top of that he does trademark wallhacker shit like glance at stupid ass angles
[02:56] <arcadeplus> pretty sure he is not a hacker
[02:56] <oldirtywhiteman> idk man he hits crazy flicks but then makes retarded movements and misses an easy shot
[02:56] <lizardwrath> to be fair destiny's team played like aids
[02:57] <daegitokki> he's not hacking...I'm playing with him
[02:57] <bobocs> well yeah i could prob hop in and rape these nerds just the same but still he clearly isn't a good player by his play style
[02:57] <arcadeplus> MG1 is literally filled with players like this
[02:57] <teimuh> these flicks are not hard like when you guys play single player games can you move ur crosshair on an enemie??
[02:57] <sykoo> Its like that analogy where sufficiently high technology will seem like magic to a less technologicaly developed person.
[02:57] <tatami2> A lot of MG players are god like with an awp but nothing else
[02:57] <sykoo> kinda same with skill gaps?
[02:57] <walking_wounded> here we go boys
[02:57] <arcadeplus> who don't know anything about the game and don't have good movement or theory or any kind of understanding of anything deep
[02:57] <arcadeplus> but just have really really fucking good aim
[02:57] <walking_wounded> that's 64 ticket server
[02:57] <astutefig76> that was a nice shot right there
[02:57] <walking_wounded> tick*
[02:57] <astutefig76> but the last one was like a noscope
[02:57] <bobocs> thing is he doesn't even have good aim lol. kids random af
[02:57] <walking_wounded> it's some weird interpolation
[02:57] <cowtell> did he shoot through a wall?
[02:58] <astutefig76> he flicked through a wall @Cowtell
[02:58] <oldirtywhiteman> true he can just play on the 24/7 awp india server and come to mm and rape
[02:58] <perfectskye> Yes, the corner.
[02:58] <hanahckim> VAPE SQUAD REPRESENT
[02:58] <destiny_bot> Destiny has a new Twitter! twitter.com/OmniDestiny
[02:58] <nateraegu> nah hes no better than steve and randomly gets 50 kills
[02:58] <daegitokki> I'm the daegitokki, he's a smurf
[02:58] <sykoo> Well, the derank made high ranked people drop down
[02:58] <lizardwrath> boboCS who are you
[02:58] <konjkave> I really don't get the movement of his crosshair
[02:58] <teimuh> his awp is not even good but do you guys understand that the enemies dont try to kill him
[02:58] <teimuh> look at all the reaction times nobody even shots back
[02:58] <konjkave> It moves by blocks
[02:58] <nateraegu> people who deserve to be high rank easily climb back up
[02:58] <paranienoidalny> never flash Kappa
[02:58] <astutefig76> what kinda sucked was that i finally got good at cs as soon as the derank update dropped
[02:59] <lizardwrath> BibleThump
[02:59] <arcadeplus> he's not smurfing, and he's not playing really well - he's just really good at flick shots and camping certain angles and aiming, and he had a lucky game
[02:59] <astutefig76> hard life for me BibleThump
[02:59] <walking_wounded> Pet Aslan @Destiny, please :D
[02:59] <levipoep> i am too afraid of the russians to play csgo over in euw
[02:59] <nateraegu> embrace the russians
[02:59] <cityls> looks like a lucky game to me
[02:59] <sykoo> Well, you didnt get worse at the game Astutefig, they just changed the rank distribution. So being MG1 now, is better than being MG1 before.
[02:59] <paranienoidalny> @ArcadePlus, i agree, but that's insane luck
[02:59] <tatami2> lucky game + awp
[02:59] <konjkave> His gun moves so fucked
[03:00] <sykoo> Well, I guess MG1 was a bad example
[03:00] <konjkave> I don't know how that is even playable
[03:00] <nateraegu> he cant aim for shit
[03:00] <mom0momo> I dont think he's hacking
[03:00] <bobocs> lol he just hits three shots down mid and can't even get a clean frag on someone point black with his fiveseven

[03:08] <robbiedowneyjr> Is he one of those guys that lost games on purpose or whatever ?
[03:08] <destiny_bot> Robot Lady will read your message for $5 or more donations twitchalerts.com/donate/destiny
[03:08] <lizardwrath> yep
[03:08] <thisisskyking> yea he was invvolved with match fixing
[03:08] <swaysickle> tsk tsk
[03:08] <thisisskyking> same with brax c9 swag
[03:10] <robbiedowneyjr> Yeah should have been a lifetime ban. Match fixing is total shit
[03:10] <thisisskyking> they are life time bans
[03:10] <thisisskyking> :/
[03:10] <robbiedowneyjr> O they are ? Lol, ok
[03:10] <turtle__loner> They're banned from tournament settings for life.
[03:10] <twitchnotify> TodaysTask subscribed to steel_tv for 2 months in a row!
[03:11] <dallery131> did destiny go to sleep?
[03:11] <thisisskyking> yea mang steel and brax cant compete at any valve events
[03:11] <robbiedowneyjr> And one of those guys was like a talent and shit right
[03:11] <robbiedowneyjr> Yeah Senpai went to sleep
[03:11] <thisisskyking> brax(c9 swag) was one of the best na kids
[03:11] <turtle__loner> You mean Swag? He's was very young and pretty darn good
[03:11] <thisisskyking> on the same lvl as shroud
[03:12] <robbiedowneyjr> Right, yes him
[03:12] <robbiedowneyjr> Saw him streaming too a while back
[03:12] <thisisskyking> wicked good to watch
[03:12] <robbiedowneyjr> But every question in chat was about fixing and stuff, he didnt look happy
[03:13] <thisisskyking> yea pretty big topic in the cs go community
[03:14] <robbiedowneyjr> I kinda feel for the young dude, even though he should have known better, when you are young you can make mistakes.
[03:14] <turtle__loner> H1Z1 DansGame
[03:14] <robbiedowneyjr> But whatever I guess
[03:14] <twitchnotify> TAPANDKILL just subscribed to steel_tv!
[03:14] <thisisskyking> thats kinda why all the c9 guys are pushing for him to get unbanned
[03:14] <thisisskyking> cuz he was young when it happend
[03:14] <turtle__loner> I don't think he should be unbanned
[03:15] <turtle__loner> But that's me
[03:15] <thisisskyking> i agree he took part in fixing
[03:15] <thisisskyking> no matter how small/large his part was
[03:16] <robbiedowneyjr> Yeah. But what I read was like that he more went along with it
[03:16] <robbiedowneyjr> The guy who set everything up should be lifetime banned for sure though
[03:17] <thisisskyking> true, but everyone needs to feel the hurt for it they all got money
[03:18] <robbiedowneyjr> Yeah. Ofcourse. Well, fukked up for them, let it serve as an example then.

[13:26] <bananathugg> @Destiny, Dont attack Destiny, just bring up a few points and say that people are very skeptical about him and his platform, and have him explain himself. You arent the only one with concerns, many a random pleb have the same feelings and suspicions as you.

[15:30] <felgalund> amazon bought twitch
[15:30] <williamernice> gay people are dumb

[15:31] <litecore> competition is good
[15:32] <tgstarcraft> TazHavoc, first problem i've experienced with twitch this year i think
[15:32] <tazhavoc> twitch is slowly becoming youtube in terms of shit and monopoly
[15:32] <kiwipaladin> there are no Athene viewbots, only Massan viewbots that got lost on other channels MrDestructoid
[15:32] <kiwipaladin> Kappa
[15:32] <hiro_tsuchiya> oil maker is for when you have piggies

[15:32] <biginshorts> i have 1 hard wood tho KappaPride
[15:32] <rivingtoniv> gotta give props to athene though. donating videos is f awesome
[15:32] <chandler711> my butt is cold
[15:32] <kappakingprime> God_Matt, athene was proven god
[15:33] <trongan> Tazhavoc I got the same problem, streams cut out all the time and my follow ist is empty since about 1 hour
[15:33] <scaz675> 3k iridium sprinklers Kreygasm
[15:33] <avingaming> even MLG dot tv has a button that links to your donation program. its not that hard to make... just like the sub button redirects to the sub page
[15:33] <issashine> Destiny are you sure they don't include a donation platform simply because they want people subscribing instead? that seems way more likely than "they are lazy lol"
[15:33] <drwilltickle> @Destiny plant some flowers near bee house for better honey
[15:33] <plast1cspoons> how the fuck do u uninstall shit
[15:33] <poio_4806> Twitch isnt working so im stuck here watching destiny play a farming game LUL
[15:33] <plast1cspoons> on windows 10
[15:34] <rivingtoniv> they earn 2.5 usd per sub so yeah...
[15:34] <skooooma> Uninstall Windows 10
[15:34] <paranienoidalny> wth is windows10?
[15:34] <tazhavoc> twitch would be dead if it didnt have a monopoly in streaming websites. If hitbox was a thing back when justintv started it would have been more evenly distributed
[15:34] <lagrizle> amazon even has their own payment system so it should be easy
[15:34] <kiwipaladin> well I mean own3D was coded by a handful of ppl, so in theory the technical part for this kinds of sites is easy to set up by truly qualified ppl. You need ppl that know how to sell your product tho, and get advertisers to work with you and whatnot
[15:35] <kiwipaladin> so yea, I guess Twitch has lazy coders Kappa
[15:35] <freemanbets> ''easy to set up by trully qualified people''
[15:35] <issashine> Plast1cSpoons, you can do it the same way as windows 7 and 8, just type in control panel from the start menu and do it the same way
[15:35] <rivingtoniv> its kinda dope though that all streamers are on one site

[15:50] <djgrisebelt> Reckful online. Bye guys reckBald reckGL
[15:50] <0jiggernew> It's not black people as a race, it''s uneducated black people and so called black culture (which is in reality a culture of poverty). When you have limited means to express yourself you tend to talk louder (like drunk people). This lack of education combined with cultural expectations and the tendency of less educated blacks to be most frequently observed by whites while in large groups results in the stereotype that black people are loud.
[15:50] <bennettyb> yfeah, so is it just like a relaxing minecraft type game with no end goal?
[15:50] <matsusama> DuckerZ
[15:50] <curtsy> @BennettYB, Well, that depends. In the end it's a farming simulator with other things added to it, you can have lots of micro management involved with how you want your farm set up.

[15:51] <itechno5> @Accepted_Aneles athene said about 14 people and maybe more people will come. They joined because they want to make a difference in the world and athene wants people with the right mindset - check out athenes "real talk" it changed peoples lives

[17:03] <potioncellar> @Sustentaculum, Gaming2Good. It was okay if you had any concerns about the Athene thing. Other than that, mostly policical memes going on. Chat is filled with Forsen Boys and Reckful dooders so it's kinda lame.
[17:03] <natescott430> if 10/100 people commit a crime, then in ten years, 11/1,000 people commit a crime, do you say there is more crime? No, because the rate went down relative to population, you cucks

[17:06] <natescott430> KiwiPaladin, #s of crimes committed vs #s of crimes committed per person, yeah I did word it awkwardly
[17:06] <aypeas> Bernie fucked up in how he was saying it. I'm pretty sure he meant that if you are white and are poor/have lived in ghettos you still don't understand the struggles black communities go through because they are enormously targeted more. Furthermore to say Bernie is racist against poor white people while HE himself grew up in poverty is kind of funny to me.

[17:25] <kiwipaladin> @Hobogames quite a few Twitch streamers first put their streams no the map with some viewbots. The peeps that click on your stream cuz you have a high viewcount only stay after if they find the stream interesting anyhow
[17:26] <deadlysnowcone> supercharged? Destiny is your new car gonna be naturally aspirated?

[17:28] <murdermantx> @EnetoLive, why would they?
[17:28] <enetolive> MurderManTX, because they make a shit ton of money off of Athene funneling to them to get them to sign on. Athene gave Soda $10k yesterday.
[17:28] <klaus43> you're such an intellectual masturbator.

[17:29] <enetolive> Panchrestum, The streamer themself decides how much goes to charity and how much they get off each donation. But either way the site itself (Athene) gets a cut of each donation

[17:30] <murdermantx> @EnetoLive, and when he's out of money, it will end. If he makes a better donation system or whatever and people flock to it, who cares. They will go whereever the best thing is and there's nothing wrong with that. Some people will get fucked along the way, that always happens. Life is a fucking risk. I don't feel threatened at all by athene and his moves. There are so many other more important things you can do to improve your stream rather than some gimmicky fucking donation shit
[17:30] <kiwipaladin> @Hobogames Amaz almost certainly viewbotted a bit at first, but guess what, peeps thought his stream was great so they stuck around.
[17:30] <panchrestum> @EnetoLive, I saw Athene saying something like "and I pay them 2x the amount they raise" that can't be real
[17:30] <meme_generator_> it's racist that at least 1 of the actors in straight out of comp didn't get nominated for an oscar
[17:30] <dulcimer> to me the movie was frustrating, because the first part of the film was interesting, but as soon as the first part was over there was absolutely zero direction
[17:30] <kappakingprime> Not trying to judge anyone, but is it any wonder why the youth of today are more violent than ever with graphic games such as this? Not trying to ruin anyones fun, but we need to be conscious of the games we support in such a global social climate. Not judging, just some food for thought.
[17:30] <enetolive> Panchrestum, That's Destiny's entire problem with it. Athene is just getting money from seemingly nowhere and giving it away to get his program big

[17:33] <kiwipaladin> but yea @Hobogames my point is that the HS community is for sure a better one with Amaz being so big, so maybe him viewbotting a bit in the beginning ended up as a good thing for the community as a whole at the end of the day ... it's funny how Blurred some lines are

[17:34] <curtsy> @NateScott430, It's was filmed under a different name and shit
[17:34] <murdermantx> @EnetoLive, athene has always been a complete joke though. He's been obnoxious from the get-go. You can't take the guy serious at all... He's always so uppity and insisting that he's the best at everything he does like a dipshit and if he wants to be a dipshit, let him. Some people will like that, who cares...
[17:34] <tspinvirus> Caps
[17:34] <momentoy> @Panchrestum, What did it fail to explain? If Destiny wasn't satisfied I doubt he'd end the call

[17:34] <roivas1> that cloverfield movie was supposed to be a standalone movie and then they just made it a cloverfield movie

[17:36] <zorize> Since destiny has his own sub thing, does it mean he is generating almost no money for Twitch? How is Twitch okay with this?
[17:36] <pacjax> everyonelovesprime, this is like the music I play 4Head
[17:36] <kiwipaladin> @Murdermantx do you think he believes he's the best at everything? Do you think most actors that play a role think they ARE the person in the play, not their real selves from irl? OMGScoots
[17:36] <enetolive> MurderManTX, But this donation platform seems super shady. I guess apparently he cleared it up with Destiny but I haven't seen the vod yet.
[17:36] <everyonelovesprime> pacjax, stream you cuck 4Head
[17:36] <nikrado> athene based his whole brand on this "persona" of being a shit person whos cocky with his actual self being a smart calm charity driven person, but the actual situation is the cocky asshole is his real self and the calm one is the "persona"
[17:36] <cozopt> @Frostynps, iunno why but that's copy pasta in like every chat right now lmao
[17:36] <ozar99> @zorize he still has twitch subs and still generations ad revenue
[17:37] <louder_howard> Zorize subbing on twich counts as a sub on his site
[17:37] <sartorou> Sax is a bit off imo.

[17:37] <pacjax> everyonelovesprime, I'm not rank 8 yet FeelsBadMan
[17:37] <kiwipaladin> I guess sometimes you have to live in character for as much as you can as an actor tho @Murdermantx but it depends from person toperson

[17:37] <murdermantx> @EnetoLive, Charity or not, doesn't make it bother me less. It's just an excuse at best. @KiwiPaladin I don't care if he believes it or not, that's the content he's chosen to put out there and that content is complete shit
[17:37] <panchrestum> @Nikrado, I think that's why people don't believe him. So much of his stuff is just acting

[17:40] <protein_egg> Pacjax makes twitch great FeelsGoodMan
[17:40] <murdermantx> @KiwiPaladin, I'm not necessarily here to prove the validity of a statement or its objective value. That statement is an opinion. His content is shit, I'm in Destiny's chat not Athenes so I don't need to suck his d!ck either
[17:40] <beijon> i think the reason for hsi youtube having high amount of subs compared to views is that his youtube channel is really old(2007) and most likely many of the old subscriber accounts are abondoned now. Not that i dont think rest of the stuff isnt shady tho...
[17:40] <teemers> what?
[17:40] <kiwipaladin> @Murdermantx some say that game X or Y or Z is complete shitt .. and they might be right to some extent .. meanwhile ten of millions of ppl play it, so they would disagree
[17:40] <frostynps> @Protein_egg you're the true MVP
[17:40] <natescott430> yura37, all the cux stuff is fake. it's all a conspiracy for destiny to play ads when he starts the stream again. don't let the CUCKS deceive you!

[21:30] <reiapls> WinterToke then yeah you should get sprinklers, they're definitely worth it
[21:31] <mangcheck> u saw athenes new video?
[21:31] <wintertoke> @Reiapls cool thanks for advise... its alot of ore so wanted to make sure it was worth it at this point
[21:31] <harmlesst> Hey how's it going?
[21:31] <tidusrox> @destiny Describe this game in a few words?
[21:32] <dizaster0> reckful just needs some rl friends it seems
[21:32] <dicedlemming> he has roommates and stuff he has rl friends he just needs motivation FeelsBadMan
[21:32] <gitgudyt> NOPE
[21:32] <lemmiiwinks> Lava fishing?
[21:32] <tanthony43> lava fishing WutFace
[21:32] <gitgudyt> level 100 only has lava eels
[21:32] <my_mmr_hell> @Tidusrox, I'm not him but It's Skinners box
[21:32] <randocchi> DICEDLEMMING, doesnt that just mean hes burnt out
[21:33] <frostiitute> This game looks so much like Tibia
[21:33] <akademiker> what is the reckful meme about?
[21:33] <gitgudyt> trust me, you get them like 99% of the time at 60
[21:33] <papa_gg> lvl 60 is the best
[21:33] <dizaster0> this game is crack
[21:33] <mangcheck> Tibia <3
[21:33] <r3ckle55> Destiny I caught ghost fish really easy on 20 like instantly lol
[21:33] <airruntv> how did your talk with Athene go @Destiny
[21:33] <frostiitute> Tibia was so fucking dank in like 2003-2005
[21:33] <tidusrox> Im playing it too. Its addicting I hope morte expansions come
[21:33] <gitgudyt> 100 has mostly lava eels that are impossible to catch but are worth 1350
[21:33] <dizaster0> but it having no ending is kinda strange but you keep wanting to play
[21:33] <kobane> Is this the Heart of Ironforge?
[21:34] <clearness> the ending for me is getting 100% achievements
[21:34] <ohcee> I got the ghostfish from lvl 40. the ghost npcs on that level drop them
[21:34] <dicedlemming> Randocchi, sure but being burnt out on life is spooky, he needs motivation to do things like shower and feed himself FeelsBirthdayMan
[21:34] <mogwaiji> What's the point of this game?
[21:34] <gitgudyt> chillaxing mog
[21:34] <reiapls> tbh the ending should be to marry all the girls and have your own harem VoHiYo
[21:34] <tingping1> just do what you want
[21:34] <dicedlemming> you just make a cool farm and buy upgrades and relax Mogwaiji
[21:34] <r3ckle55> @Mogwaiji, theres no point to the game you just play mindlessly while having infinite fun
[21:34] <dizaster0> does destiny have a dank fishing rod or somthing how he catch so quick?
[21:34] <szble> i would need intense music to play this game as well LUL
[21:34] <nerias1337> LUL
[21:35] <randocchi> DICEDLEMMING, probably just needs a new hobby or should go live in a monastery
[21:35] <baroncrustacean> Why is this game so popular?
[21:35] <dizaster0> its crack
[21:35] <natures_duality> All the garbage FeelsPartyMan
[21:35] <potioncellar> Hi guys :) Back from my shower. What memes did I miss?
[21:35] <gitgudyt> try 100 and suffer!
[21:35] <xiondisc> The point of this game is to waste time on your own terms.
[21:35] <natures_duality> oops
[21:35] <dicedlemming> Randocchi, i wnat to live in a monastery so bad but rl responsibilities FeelsBadMan
[21:35] <mogwaiji> Okey sounds numbing
[21:35] <gitgudyt> its like ironman and hardmode in one if you wanna catch a lava eel without the right bopper
[21:35] <randocchi> DICEDLEMMING, you wouldnt have any if you lived in a monastery
[21:35] <randocchi> DICEDLEMMING, its not too late to start fresh
[21:35] <dicedlemming> Randocchi, what if the bill collectors come to the monastery
[21:35] <teeroy2> what a monastery?

[21:36] <dizaster0> @destiny you not liking the ingame soundtrack?
[21:36] <nicolae_stavrogin> depends on the monastery. your best choice to be away from bullshit is to be a total recluse and live alone in the mountains
[21:36] <idra5ever> !song
[21:36] <nicolae_stavrogin> ascetic life
[21:36] <szble> become an asian monk for 10 years
[21:36] <randocchi> szble gets it

[21:38] <dizaster0> Why live in a monastery when we have stardew valley Kappa

[22:04] <pacjax> Destiny why not socialize most thing in the united states relating to insurance and health
[22:04] <deanowlord1> How well does this game fit the Harvest Moon niche Destiny?
[22:05] <sightbain> @revalence123, because g2a offers several thousand per month as sponsorship and they have the actual marketplace with legit keys buried deep inside their greymarket. so some people need the money or cant justify saying no when there is a legit portion to g2a
[22:05] <pacjax> why not socialize life insurance and car insurance

[23:04] <mrduck152> @T0mthomas I've never worked with swift, how does it compare with objective c
[23:04] <bweeoop> there are holes that take you down multiple levels
[23:04] <nogg_noskill> Pacjax isn't here FeelsGoodMan
[23:04] <shrubs> need to destroy stones to find holes
[23:04] <leviathan760> FeelsGoodMan

[23:04] <richardeeee> Or make your own ladders
[23:05] <moneyddragon> hop Stardew come out Vita and 3D
[23:05] <frostychobo94> just bring a lot of food next time
[23:05] <satipler1234> @destiny did you know you can place down stairs and they'll open up a ladder?
[23:05] <diazstation> snifty94, encrypt some shit
[23:05] <t0mthomas> @Mrduck152 i havent either because I enjoy sanity. It probably follows no syntax convention and tries to think for you though
[23:05] <erexshun> pacjax isn't here, #fuckpacjax
[23:05] <gawntlet> I wonder if pacjx has alt accounts that he uses to spy on us
[23:05] <diazstation> snifty94, but you can use algorithms that exist already so it is not hard
[23:05] <curtsy> @moneyddragon, Lol, the game is made by one dude. If that ever happens if would be years
[23:05] <perfectskye> Why is Pacjax a huge meme?
[23:05] <knockturnalemissons> I would love to dust off my vita and play stardew on it
[23:06] <snifty94> @DiazStation Google the rest :^)
[23:06] <gawntlet> just a nice guy who just wants to combo you know
[23:06] <erexshun> I love playing stardew on PC doe
[23:06] <burritobanditoe> @destiny I cheated through these mines by gathering a fuckton of stone... By using 99 stone you can make a protable ladder that gets you down 1 floor. you can also kill the mummies by hitting them until they drop then bombing them. OCcasionally you will find holes in the ground that drop you a random number of floors
[23:06] <moneyddragon> @Curtsy, Sony and Nintendo can help them easy , money talk
[23:06] <requisiteofed> Because he's an ape and people like reminding him, Perfectskye
[23:06] <pittski> Destiny I know you played final fantasy tactics for awhile. just curious have you played any of the disgaea games?
[23:07] <mscherrykiss> I "cheated" my way to lv 25 by using the crafted stairs down :} took about 10 of those
[23:07] <satipler1234> @burritobanditoe do stairs open the non-ladder holes ever?
[23:07] <mrduck152> @diazstation just ask stackoverflow for the answer leruse
[23:07] <pianoconspiracy> Destiny, you can just kite them to one side of the room and then run back and they'll get stuck on walls, or de aggro
[23:07] <italianoble> you can craft stairs for 99 stones i believe
[23:07] <akademiker> @diazstation just copy paste aes-cbc.c from apples archive
[23:07] <burritobanditoe> @Satipler1234 Could you be more specifc? I dont understand the question
[23:08] <satipler1234> @burritobanditoe like when you craft ladders for 99 stone, does it always spawn a hole that takes you down just one level? Or can it spawn the holes that take you down multiple floors at a time?
[23:08] <moneyddragon> wow Apple just won again FBI LOL
[23:09] <moneyddragon> http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/07/apple-iphone-new-york-case-fbi-encryption
[23:09] <hoursunend> this is like zelda for ***
[23:09] <bweeoop> lmao
[23:09] <konjkave> nice backdoor trojan virus moneyddragon
[23:09] <burritobanditoe> @Satipler1234 When you create a portable ladder you can only go down one level. The holes that bring you down multiple are random, most of them drop you 7 floors
[23:09] <moneyddragon> @konjkave, -____-
[23:10] <burritobanditoe> @Satipler1234 I used about 5-6 portable ladders and found holes to beath the sand caves

[23:30] <bill_nye_the_spy> overwatch isn't terrible though, I'll give them that
[23:30] <kane2013> just because the product is bad doesnt make the company bad
[23:30] <consectatrix> Bill you're late to the party, the games at blizzard have sucked for a while now
[23:30] <midnight_ahri> @Destiny, who won the debate between shillary and bernie?
[23:30] <lemmiiwinks> I wouldn't know because no beta FeelsBadMan
[23:30] <altriaten> if you had to pay for heroes OVerwatch would of been terrible
[23:30] <kingofnopants1> they are pretty fantastic at making popular games

[23:33] <bigdonger123> ^EleGiggle
[23:33] <bill_nye_the_spy> @CraterLord considering there games are shit and retards continue to support them, yes, how dare they
[23:33] <kane2013> Lagrizle 99% of the internet are girls ? PogChamp
[23:33] <destiny_bot> Robot Lady will read your message for $5 or more donations twitchalerts.com/donate/destiny
[23:34] <craterlord> Bill_Nye_the_Spy, have you considered that maybe people support them because they still happen to like what they produce? Crazy idea, I know
[23:34] <lagrizle> Obviously @Kane2013 i see new singles in my area appearing daily
[23:34] <kane2013> yea Lagrizle do they keep stalking you when you move aswell? Kinda creepy
[23:34] <craterlord> Bill_Nye_the_Spy, or does that not matter, simply because it doesnt suit you personally?
[23:34] <lemmiiwinks> brb FapFapFap
[23:34] <bill_nye_the_spy> @CraterLord yes I realize people enjoy in-taking shit
[23:34] <dvydvyv> Play some csgo homes
[23:35] <shinugo> Where is this music from? Is it within the game?
[23:35] <bill_nye_the_spy> @CraterLord, because if they lose business they'll either have to start creating actual good games again or go under, either I'm fine with
[23:35] <lagrizle> Blizzard is in almost a similar boat as Nintendo that regardless of quality people by it for nostalgia
[23:35] <drkirbyx> In before you get robbed
[23:35] <craterlord> Bill_Nye_the_Spy, want to describe to me your thought process when determining whether or not a game is objectively good?
[23:35] <icystarblast> hi
[23:36] <lagrizle> hi
[23:36] <redkangarew> Game music is too loud
[23:36] <redkangarew> Dang
[23:36] <redkangarew> It just the music
[23:36] <evixious> misuc is too loud
[23:36] <redkangarew> *
[23:36] <consectatrix> It doesn't really matter if a game is good or not as long as people are baited into buying it for huge amounts of cash
[23:36] <kane2013> Craterlord his is if like = 1 good=true
[23:36] <magnesiumbox> destiny why dont you FILL the feed tray instead of just 1 spot
[23:36] <ipickflowers> HeyGuys
[23:36] <esoterikk> Sc2 is dead insofar as it's stopped growing and the current size can only go down

[23:37] <yuwwu> ded gaem
[23:37] <kane2013> yea, people sitll play warcraft III
[23:37] <bill_nye_the_spy> sure, WoW is shit now a days, too much to explain in one post, but essentially they dumbed everything down for the shitters, sc2 is dead, d3 is inferior to PoE, and I have no interest in playing a p2w card game, let alone a card game
[23:37] <hockey2222_> Y is this game so popular
[23:37] <bill_nye_the_spy> overwatch is decent though, like I said earlier
[23:37] <hockey2222_> ?
[23:37] <esoterikk> Overwatch looks fun
[23:37] <midnight_ahri> sc2 is dead, that's why i play warcraft 1

[23:37] <destiny_bot> Horizon - Frames last.fm/user/stevenbonnellii
[23:37] <esoterikk> Have they announced a ranking system for overwatch yet though?
[23:38] <tinymanticore> Yes
[23:38] <thisisacer> overwatch is decent? LOL it's the most casual game from blizzard by far
[23:38] <craterlord> Bill_Nye_the_Spy, you havent really answered anything though, thats all your subjective taste.
[23:38] <tinymanticore> TBD whether its coming out on release though.
[23:38] <bill_nye_the_spy> as long as they don't make you pay for heroes that come out later in overwatch, the game might actually be there only good one
[23:38] <lordlynkz> @destiny look at my stream, I have song in a non cluttered way
[23:38] <esoterikk> I don't think its possible to get more casual than hots
[23:38] <evixious> dude
[23:38] <thisisacer> Bill_Nye_the_Spy, you have no idea what you are talking about
[23:38] <hell3nix> Seananners Hype!
[23:38] <ez0daking900> hello i am new
[23:38] <bill_nye_the_spy> @CraterLord ok tell me which blizzard games aren't shit
[23:38] <consectatrix> @Bill_nye_the_spy people still play those games because they are good at them, imagine pouring your heart and soul into a game for several years then having to move to a game you've never played and know nothing about
[23:39] <evixious> pls lower the volume
[23:39] <kane2013> so Bill_nye_the_spy the only game they have actually been working on the last few years as a actualy game, even thought they canned it and put the assets in something else, is enough for your to consider it a good game
[23:39] <statistologist> lower music volume BibleThump
[23:39] <consectatrix> Starcraft 1 Kappa
[23:39] <esoterikk> I do find it funny that overwatch only exists because they couldn't figure out how to make titan work
[23:39] <frostynps> ( . Y . )
[23:39] <craterlord> Bill_Nye_the_Spy, I dont find any of blizzards games to be good nowadays, but apparently others do. Im asking you, who am I to call the games shit?
[23:39] <kane2013> Esoterikk they know best that mmos dont work like they did 10 years ago

[23:42] <bill_nye_the_spy> @Kane2013 thats not an excuse
[23:42] <kane2013> Bill_nye_the_spy which are supported and developed because there are enough people that like them
[23:42] <thisisacer> i guess you have no idea what reasoning is
[23:42] <droogle32> wow
[23:42] <lagrizle> @Destiny, did you ever look at The Culling?
[23:42] <sci_venom> no reason to hate if it's not your jam i love dayz every once in a while
[23:43] <deandret> What is destiny saying with that post?
[23:43] <kane2013> Bill_nye_the_spy so you think a company that drops support for games that still has followers is good
[23:43] <zongopbongo> BUTT
[23:43] <scottynapalmn> how can you love something every once in a while?
[23:43] <zongopbongo> HE SAID BUTT

[23:44] <quotenfotze> wow, SC2 sure has changed a lot
[23:44] <ipickflowers> hey guys type 9 for destiny
[23:44] <esoterikk> Dayz always seemed like an amateur basement modder game
[23:44] <tinymanticore> Destiny should just run a farm in real life that we can watch grow while he reacts to various things.
[23:44] <ipickflowers> 9
[23:44] <watergrip> not to be a creep, but Ive always been curious where destiny is located. anyone know?
[23:44] <thisisacer> Bill_Nye_the_Spy, i really don't think it is worth it to argue with you tbh.
[23:45] <ggez_mon> you need proper infrastructure before adding minor features like guns
[23:45] <modfare2> wtf did i just walk into, what is he ranting about
[23:45] <thxmanny> project mismanagement will kill any project
[23:45] <deadlysnowcone> Destiny would you rather have a black gun with 60 fps or a colored gun with 24 fps?
[23:45] <curtsy> @Watergrip, Omaha nebraska
[23:45] <ipickflowers> Watergrip, obama nebraska
[23:45] <thxmanny> and will result in a massive loss of money
[23:45] <watergrip> ahhh i see. like 311
[23:45] <bill_nye_the_spy> @thisisacer because you don't have an argument
[23:45] <kane2013> Thisisacer yea like, he calls the company bad and then says the only game they actualy made, which isnt even as good as they intende, is good....
[23:45] <akademiker> you are currently watching a virtual redneck working in a virtual farm ranting about virtual politics
[23:45] <droogle32> lol
[23:45] <esoterikk> There's a good chance they are just using an ADT at this point and don't actually understand the source code
[23:45] <kim_jong_chill_> O B T U S E
[23:45] <droogle32> did he just call his gf retarded?
[23:46] <sci_venom> wow this guy is angry
[23:46] <thefriend111> @Destiny, As a developer myself. The Day z devs were pretty incompetent. They released a very unfinished game and padded out the launch with cosmetics while they fumbled adding new features.
[23:46] <zongopbongo> : ( dont talk to hot grill like that
[23:46] <bill_nye_the_spy> @Kane2013 have you played overwatch?
[23:46] <kripps_babies> yeah wtf, chill out

[23:46] <jerrytheret> @Destiny Most companys want to skimp on progammers because they cost about 2 times as much as artists and so they hire artist to "Inflate content" to have stuff sell
[23:46] <kane2013> Bill_nye_the_spy no, why does it matter?
[23:46] <malphasx> Mad cause bad? 4Head
[23:46] <k4ez> hmmm idk about this

[23:46] <nyafuu> lol
[23:46] <nyafuu> bye
[23:46] <thisisacer> Bill_Nye_the_Spy, i don't need an argument because you only presented an opinion yourself. No need to reason that because nobody gives a fuck about your opinion anyway
[23:46] <statistologist> no dog, no stages, it's all agile bro
[23:46] <droogle32> im bout to subscribe you kidding me
[23:46] <scottynapalmn> this is why I watch Destiny, because you people can't take an argument
[23:46] <bill_nye_the_spy> @Kane2013 i have, that's why I said it was good. It's a fun shooter
[23:46] <akademiker> destiny got a point
[23:46] <esoterikk> Destiny They probably don't know how to modify the source code and are using ADT's to implement the easy shit
[23:46] <crimsonkill> hahahaha
[23:46] <reiapls> yeah people are so soft lmao
[23:46] <kane2013> Bill_nye_the_spy yea.. and yet you called the company bad
[23:46] <scottynapalmn> please leave plebs, there is a reason this chat is not even paid attention to lol
[23:46] <k4ez> calling his gf retarded
[23:47] <kripps_babies> theres a point of taking an arguement and going to hard in an arguement
[23:47] <okfloorit> Don't get butt hurt if you can't backup your argument lmfao
[23:47] <statistologist> @Esoterikk ADT as in abstract data type? Does that even make sense?
[23:47] <nordanvind> what game are we talking about?
[23:47] <xiondisc> droogle32, No, he called akademiker retarded.
[23:47] <lagrizle> The witness is a good example of a game that did development right.
[23:47] <akademiker> is ADT some arma shit?
[23:47] <droogle32> oh i thought that was the girls name
[23:47] <esoterikk> @statistologist, ADT as in function interface
[23:47] <nubtrain> look at dota 2 alpha icons
[23:47] <malphasx> XJ9 beat Destiny in an argument 4Head
[23:47] <bill_nye_the_spy> @Kane2013 they are, one good game out of, what is it, 5 others now, isn't as great record

[23:47] <mani_san> does he use Audacity as a music player?
[23:47] <scottynapalmn> where's XJ9 now? oh yeah gone
[23:48] <statistologist> @Esoterikk What are you talking about? Are you saying they're just using libraries they don't understand?
[23:48] <curtsy> @mani_san, no
[23:48] <malphasx> XJ9 dieded 4Head
[23:48] <lagrizle> @thisisacer, I agree, wish it was. but thats very doubtful

[23:48] <kane2013> Bill_nye_the_spy 5 others? As i said, hearthstone was a few guys, hots was a few guys, both was liked so they supported the fans that wanted it. How are they bad when they work on what their fans wanted? D3? 4+ Years old, wow? 10+ years old SC2? 6 Years old
[23:48] <thisisacer> Lagrizle, well game of the year for me (and anyone with a brain Kappa)
[23:48] <malphasx> Grill is like. I don't give a sh1t 4Head
[23:48] <esoterikk> @statistologist, With a project as big as Arma not all developers will even have access to the source code outside of the function interface, it's how software development works, the DayZ devs probably have few people who can properly modify source code
[23:49] <curtsy> @akademiker, dayz actually has a stand alone client, which is still 100% garbage
[23:49] <kane2013> Bill_nye_the_spy as i said, the only game they actualy work on, is one you like, yet you call the company bad.
[23:49] <statistologist> @Esoterikk yeah I just have no idea why you're referring to it as ADT...
[23:49] <akademiker> @curtsy the standalone client is still arma

[23:49] <jack_dannox> hahahaha
[23:49] <00000000000000allahuakbar> FeelsBadMan
[23:49] <deandret> If Blizzard knows they're gonna make x game why wouldn't they develop art assets before the basic game programming is done? I understand where you're coming from, but I don't think DayZ is an example of this. It feels like the problem is that they keep going in one direction with the game and then suddenly decide that they want to change direction. That forces them to redesign a bunch of shit and the game just goes nowhere because of it.

[00:46] <leinnocentbystander> C U C K E D

[00:47] <allaboutbooty> @Destiny, you should try to play games with Reckful sometime. I don't feel like you guys really have video game chemistry, but he talks about being depressed all the time. Talk to him man!
[00:47] <axle_bro> a 50 bomb?!?! haHAA
[00:47] <perfectskye> @Drewzy_drew It's this strange mental trap that you don't really know that you're in UNTIL you're in so much emotional pain that you have to do something about it. And once you exercise discipline, things get better and even out.

[01:36] <iisgwas> @Maiayenuhs becuz its hard 2 do
[01:37] <mrell> OuO
[01:37] <italianoble> does he even read twitch chat?
[01:37] <natescott430> iIsGwas, no it's actually because he met his quota for autistic donations so any more don't count
[01:37] <manshaftfit> is this neopets
[01:37] <iisgwas> @Natescott430 wait until he gets the g4g stuff
[01:37] <natescott430> manshaftfit, no this is neodestinypets
[01:37] <konjkave> Nah this is waruipets
[01:37] <manshaftfit> noice
[01:38] <maiayenuhs> I bet if Kripp was playing this he would have a spreadsheet and have everyone of his viewers names as farm animals

[01:40] <brock4ever> gamingforgood, an alternative to twitch alerts donations
[01:41] <brock4ever> Basicaly allows donators to donate money and auto-play a video/recorded sound and is tied to the amount of money you donate
[01:41] <natescott430> what are the pros/cons of switching to g4g? do they let you be more creative with retard donations or something?
[01:41] <brock4ever> creates ultra-cancerous streams of music spam and shit
[01:41] <natescott430> Brock4ever, oh ok sounds dank but cancerous

[01:41] <herolake> GTG
[01:41] <italianoble> yeah the streams are super cancer
[01:41] <konjkave> The pros of g4g, get money, have a cancerous donation experience, the cons: g4g down Athene's massive cock
[01:41] <diarrhea_holocaust> a con is that in a sense you're working for Athene
[01:42] <thekentuckyfrydcow> if i have to listen to you fagots voccaroo your meme donations i will legitimately vote for trump

[01:42] <bananathugg> I wanna see Destiny use G4G for 1 day
[01:42] <brock4ever> destiny would probably see a huge influx in donations though imo
[01:42] <brock4ever> especialy if athene does his fake donations to him to spark interest LUL
[01:42] <yura37> Destiny please try G4G while its not frowned upon
[01:43] <bananathugg> Destiny should just be like, "If I dont make 20k then Athene is lying Kappa "
[01:43] <italianoble> i think he would quit after some hours
[01:43] <bananathugg> then Athene will stealth donate 20k
[01:43] <italianoble> donations can be so cancerous

[01:59] <johnspecter> Can't Germany just make concentration camps like they did in the past?
[01:59] <brock4ever> This is just getting sad
[01:59] <vybslol> Lithuanians are known for beating up random black people. They call it 'wog bashing'. I'm not sure how they would react to an influx of Muslims.
[01:59] <gotta_draw> thanks for not talkin politics again
[01:59] <oldirtywhiteman> Why can we just put the refugees in a concentrated area so they disturb the locals
[01:59] <oldirtywhiteman> cant*
[01:59] <johnspecter> Yes, Germany knows how to do it.
[02:00] <xeropoint> LonLon Farm! Nice!
[02:00] <konjkave> You mean concentration camps?
[02:00] <italianoble> some people were proposing getting an island for all the refugees
[02:00] <brock4ever> Americans call them internment camps
[02:00] <roivas1> >.>
[02:00] <konjkave> Studies show concentration does not improve in concentration camps despite their name.
[02:00] <roivas1> just let them go to turkey
[02:00] <italianoble> lol
[02:00] <tak_ada> notice me senpai
[02:01] <liusslo> JohnSpecter point is that like 95% people have no clue about the cause. they just see the result of that... @JohnSpecter
[02:01] <curtsy> Also if anyone wants to have it more "zoomed out" you can use GeDoSaTo to downsample to get the effect of a higher resolution
[02:01] <omnommyface> Anyone else getting the glitch with their husband or wife where they say the house is a mess but there is literally no furniture in the house?
[02:01] <oldirtywhiteman> after ww2 jews were put in camps in cyprus until they could move to israel LUL

[02:04] <johnspecter> In all honesty, I'd rather have black people than Muslims.
[02:04] <yura37> seems legit
[02:04] <vybslol> The only political party fighting against the Muslims here in the UK is the BNP, but you can lose your job for openly supporting them and their voting database has been hacked and leaked to the public numerous times.
[02:04] <roivas1> vote UKIP
[02:04] <johnspecter> wow @VybsLOL
[02:04] <oldirtywhiteman> I would rather we just kill all humans
[02:05] <johnspecter> Most humans are good.
[02:05] <sheeps2> how do you zoom out the game?
[02:05] <ashes2049> oldirtywhiteman, you can start with yourself
[02:05] <johnspecter> Don't let the Mudslime Apples ruin us all.
[02:05] <sanauu> @oldirtywhiteman, can't we just talk about wanting to have sex with minors without being labeled as pedophiles?
[02:05] <italianoble> extremists are the problem..

[02:07] <yura37> so are the baltics
[02:07] <johnspecter> @yura37, Might be right. Russia might not be that bad.
[02:07] <kane2013> FailFish
[02:08] <yura37> just dont go anywhere near moscow and russia is fine

[02:08] <penguindkx> just marry one of Putin's daughters, then you cna chill in russia
[02:08] <johnspecter> what's wrong with Moscow?

[02:09] <xxmjspecterxx> ah
[02:09] <skulblake> Nice racism dude, I hope you feel good being molded by propaganda. The medias always show f*cked up people just to sell more. They're actually doctors, teachers, lawyers and very educated people that had to flee their country because of some f*cked up people.

[02:09] <johnspecter> In Germany you now need to wear an arm band if you're not a Mudslime.
[02:09] <natescott430> Ashes2049, to be fair, there's not much aggression in g2a sponsorship. Put their logo on your channel = free money. Pretty unaggressive, albeit possibly unethical.
[02:09] <oldirtywhiteman> most of the immigrants in canada are cool
[02:10] <yura37> and should also be eradicated
[02:10] <curtsy> We're not taking in refugees, we're taking in bottom feeding welfare families
[02:10] <johnspecter> hahahah
[02:10] <yura37> every single fucking one
[02:10] <kane2013> Curtsy humans are human
[02:10] <ashes2049> NateScott430, yeah maybe aggressive not the right term, more like prolific
[02:10] <lamen7> Does anyone know if they whether or not the days are inclusive or exclusive? So for example I have 4 days left not counting the current day for parsnip

[02:10] <italianoble> canada has a lot of diversity from what i've heard
[02:10] <curtsy> @Kane2013, Yes, and some are worth less than others.
[02:10] <williamernice> canada is a communist country, no?
[02:10] <kane2013> Curtsy and that is how you become a racist piece of shit
[02:10] <diarrhea_holocaust> all white countries has plenty of diversity these days
[02:10] <johnspecter> The US is the true melting pot.
[02:11] <oldirtywhiteman> most big cities are pretty diverse
[02:11] <skulblake> The medias will concentrate on the shitty places just because it sells, but the reality is very different, and if you and your mom would be in the same situation, you'd be happy to flee to another country where you're not threaten by the possibility of being decapitated just because you don't wanna cover your face

[02:27] <spazzodin> i'll be honest, i dont get the appeal to kanye music mostly
[02:27] <fscorpio27> FailFish
[02:27] <williamernice> You sure you want to live amongst those dirty fucking sandmonkeys?
[02:27] <spazzodin> its so boring to me idk
[02:27] <bitbycharlie> kanye's music went lame
[02:28] <bludgeonelderlies> scarecrows do 20
[02:28] <iisgwas> kanye is basically the biggest superstar ever
[02:28] <bitbycharlie> he used to be so good till he got cocky
[02:28] <bludgeonelderlies> 20 square area
[02:28] <spazzodin> like what is this shit, im falling asleep
[02:28] <caustik45> @Spazzodin, all kanye or just new?
[02:28] <fscorpio27> thank god lol
[02:28] <caustik45> I personally like college dropout
[02:28] <spazzodin> just new
[02:28] <caustik45> yeah
[02:28] <caustik45> i feel same way.,
[02:28] <spazzodin> TLOP specifically
[02:28] <caustik45> agreed
[02:28] <curtsy> @BludgeonElderlies, scarecrows were reduced
[02:28] <omarquiroz831> Finally talked lmao
[02:28] <bludgeonelderlies> thats dumb
[02:28] <williamernice> @Spazzodin, What kind of music do you listen to buddy?
[02:28] <spazzodin> like everyone sucked it off but I'm just sitting here like, am I the only one that wasnt blown away by it?
[02:28] <chineseninjawarriorx> yo stop googling everything thats cheating
[02:28] <spazzodin> I listen to most genres
[02:28] <fscorpio27> should be enough room
[02:29] <fscorpio27> its called RESEARCH KappaCool
[02:29] <spazzodin> I like Kendrick's last album but idk, TLOP was so bad
[02:29] <spazzodin> *shrug*
[02:29] <izzyftw> i dont think TLOP was bad
[02:29] <kane2013> why doesnt he just go to a tree in game FailFish
[02:29] <izzyftw> but it wasnt great for ye
[02:29] <bludgeonelderlies> kanye was better when he made music for other people
[02:29] <spazzodin> The best part of TLOP was a sample and him rapping over someone elses track
[02:29] <natescott430> Spazzodin, I only really like wolves & real friends. The rest are either okay/bad
[02:29] <iisgwas> guys what is the best money making method in this game
[02:29] <brock4ever> the best album of all time is Willenium by Will Smith
[02:29] <fscorpio27> 1 space should be enough
[02:29] <synxern> u need 2 spaces between each
[02:29] <spazzodin> Pt 2 is good
[02:29] <fscorpio27> oh ok
[02:29] <synxern> it says so when u try to plant
[02:30] <natescott430> BludgeonElderlies, yeah he's a great producer, but not of his own music FeelsBadMan
[02:30] <bludgeonelderlies> hotdog water by limp bizkit is kanye's best album
[02:30] <issashine> reminder that the best album of 2015 was meliora by ghost and if you disagree you are a mongrel SeemsGood
[02:30] <midg3tluvslave> i believe you need 1 space because fruit trees need to be 3 tiles apart
[02:30] <izzyftw> What??? MBDTF was great
[02:30] <brock4ever> who is ghost
[02:30] <izzyftw> and his college trilogy was great
[02:30] <excaliberx18> TPAB the best rap album of the decade tbh
[02:30] <spazzodin> kanye is the king of just rapping over other peoples stuff
[02:30] <fscorpio27> time to science it sounds like
[02:30] <spazzodin> smh
[02:30] <grly> destiny trees dont need scarecrows
[02:30] <tak_ada> damn.. the lyrics
[02:30] <izzyftw> meliora was so good issa
[02:30] <chineseninjawarriorx> nigga dick
[02:30] <issashine> Brock4ever, this is ghost https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOrXKiSy8ZY
[02:31] <bludgeonelderlies> kanye is forced to be a publicity whore because of who he is married to. you only get an opportunity to make that much money once. i choose to invest time/money into real artists though who make what they make as a means of expression not as a means of exploitation
[02:31] <vogue_hommes> HeyGuys
[02:31] <natescott430> Issashine, cover reminds me of silence of the lambs
[02:31] <spazzodin> what happened to him fixin wolves
[02:31] <iisgwas> kanye is a living meme and I support that
[02:31] <spazzodin> and putting sia on it that actually sounded good
[02:31] <gotta_draw> I did mine like this but you can probably do it with 1 space between trees instead of 2 https://imgur.com/gNsZpnk
[02:31] <natescott430> BludgeonElderlies, he was a publicity whore long before he married kim
[02:31] <fscorpio27> yea i hope he knows trees dont need scarecrows
[02:32] <gotta_draw> but whatever flooring so shit doesn't grow
[02:32] <penguindkx> EYY
[02:32] <fscorpio27> i got the shroom wallpaper in this game its baws
[02:32] <chineseninjawarriorx> is this prerecorded?
[02:32] <fscorpio27> CHAccepted
[02:32] <bludgeonelderlies> not at this same level he is at now. before he was in the public eye for being a good artist and for his mom dying and for getting in a car accident.

[02:56] <bludgeonelderlies> i have no food so i am drinking baked beans out of the can because my silver ware is dirty
[02:56] <bluffforrent> the division is amazing
[02:57] <docjdaws90> Holy shit, has he been going for 12 hours now?
[02:58] <taichouloki> !live
[02:58] <bludgeonelderlies> he just woke up and started streaming again
[02:58] <destiny_bot> Live with 2202 viewers for ~6h 12m
[02:58] <docjdaws90> Hokay, makes sense.
[02:58] <geegeebby> 'Just woke up
[02:58] <geegeebby> '
[02:58] <esoterikk> Im curious how the PvE of division will stay interesting considering its the same humans over and over
[02:58] <ethanc23> well, if you plant one, then wait for it to sync with the others, no triggering needed
[02:59] <bludgeonelderlies> when you don't wipe that well the first time and get monkeybutt
[02:59] <issashine> >the division >interesting LUL
[03:00] <bludgeonelderlies> all day i dream about stank
[03:00] <julien199877> then youre not playing enough Kappa
[03:00] <rhanza> i dream about myself being happy
[03:00] <duck0056> how many hours is he into this game?
[03:00] <bludgeonelderlies> you dream about me farting on your balls rhanza?
[03:01] <rhanza> yeaha its pretty cute
[03:01] <gotta_draw> what's the division and why is everyone hyping it
[03:01] <bludgeonelderlies> you have a gorgeous set of toes
[03:01] <rhanza> m8
[03:01] <bananathugg> Guys, I found a never before seen meme :O hillshire.tv/yee
[03:01] <bill_nye_the_spy> theres no reason to hype the division, its alright, but everyone not going to play it in a week
[03:01] <bludgeonelderlies> i found a never before seen gun
[03:01] <bill_nye_the_spy> plus its ubisoft
[03:02] <brock4ever> the division looks like a 3rd person version of borderlands
[03:02] <brock4ever> I'd rather play borderlands
[03:02] <bludgeonelderlies> ubisoft aka lubehiscock
[03:03] <thejimmychew87> @Destiny is there a method to your storage madness?
[03:03] <bludgeonelderlies> he puts it wherever it fits just like my policy when i fuck
[03:04] <destiny_bot> Remember to use Destiny's Amazon referral link! destiny.gg/amazon
[03:04] <ashes2049> isn't that called the bible

[03:05] <issashine> POTTER****
[03:05] <bludgeonelderlies> if you fondle me under the blankeys
[03:05] <westwilde> how old is destiny?
[03:05] <godob> What is this? I came here for destiny not some Harvest Moon ripoff Kapa
[03:05] <godob> crap
[03:05] <docjdaws90> 27
[03:05] <godob> Kappa
[03:06] <emperorevan> one of the few people who did not switch from stardew to the division when it launched lol
[03:06] <bludgeonelderlies> thats crazy bro are u in cahoots w nasa to get that technology???
[03:06] <gawntlet> Issashine all?
[03:06] <emperorevan> Love this game
[03:06] <rofl_rory> How much did your setup cost?
[03:07] <gawntlet> Issashine sounds fun.
[03:07] <mom0momo> Okay
[03:07] <mom0momo> Last call for !momolewds
[03:07] <ashes2049> Destiny, it basically has instanced dungeons
[03:07] <bill_nye_the_spy> you can change the difficulty on missions in the division
[03:07] <emperorevan> I mean a lot of people were streaming stardew until The dividion launched and then switched over
[03:07] <trraviis> god dman
[03:07] <accepted_aneles> division is out and hes playing this game? lmfao
[03:07] <bill_nye_the_spy> it's not worth playing right now, laggy and shit
[03:08] <accepted_aneles> this is like farmville on facebook
[03:08] <gibberjabber> gw2 is "free" but it technically isnt....there is still caps and limitations for the free to play versions.
[03:08] <accepted_aneles> or terraria : Farm DLC
[03:08] <ashes2049> gotta get on that day 1 hype though, even if the game isn't working
[03:08] <bill_nye_the_spy> no this is harvest moon, you're just too young to know what that is
[03:08] <konjkave> @Issashine I have never seen harry potter
[03:08] <emperorevan> when this game gets multiplayer it will probably be better then the Division :) lol
[03:08] <accepted_aneles> sorry i dont play shit games
[03:08] <esoterikk> Wait its not even an MMO, fuck that then
[03:08] <bill_nye_the_spy> kek
[03:08] <issashine> destiny its basically multiplayer open world borderlands, its really not that great..
[03:09] <julien199877> "What is the bottleneck of my computer?" "Everything"
[03:09] <potioncellar> Have a good night @Destiny
[03:09] <potioncellar> Goodnight chat <3
[03:09] <konjkave> Night potioncellar
[03:09] <bill_nye_the_spy> it
[03:09] <emperorevan> I remember playing harvest moon a ton back in the day so I was excited to see a similar game hit steam
[03:09] <gawntlet> Potioncellar o/
[03:10] <lavadm> The gameplay is fun, its more similar to destiny
[03:10] <hebian> @Destiny when are you tryin out gamingforgood
[03:10] <potioncellar> Love you all VoHiYo <3
[03:10] <lavadm> Not sure how the end game plays out though
[03:10] <bill_nye_the_spy> it's alright, you just can't take what videos they put out as actual gameplay all the time
[03:10] <emperorevan> oooo a greenhouse? thats cool
[03:11] <prozaka> the mine is annoying as shit, if i could play this game without doing it at all it would so much more fun
[03:11] <emperorevan> I'm still in the first year lol Having fun though
[03:11] <bill_nye_the_spy> better gear, more xp
[03:11] <deadlysnowcone> Destiny, from the beta it looked like standard 3rd person shooter single player, mmo mechanics for items and levels, and dayZ PvP area with some small mmo mechanics
[03:11] <emperorevan> Well Prozaka maybe when multiplayer hits you can let a friend deal with the mine lol
[03:11] <bill_nye_the_spy> dark zone is fun\
[03:12] <bill_nye_the_spy> if you hunt down rogue agents
[03:12] <ghostmylight> How I long for the alternate universe where quake style fps won out over this cs shit
[03:13] <deadlysnowcone> like CoD? I heard that still runs on quake 3
[03:13] <pokebrah> Destiny you should play poker with Reckful
[03:14] <mantheonthenippletwister> ^
[03:14] <destiny_bot> Destiny updates YouTube regularly now! "Discussing flat tax with a caller" posted 12h 14m ago youtu.be/OeZmoxpLUPc
[03:15] <esoterikk> I'll wait a month and if people are still playing it ill buy it
[03:15] <esoterikk> probably wont be though judging by the attention span of the target base
[03:15] <issashine> im gonna go watch harry potter

[03:19] <italianoble> why is chat silent?
[03:19] <autod> Pretty sure its the same just get the money right away
[03:19] <shorizor> most ppl use the chat on his website
[03:20] <krisatlas> Then why ever use the box?
[03:20] <russific> if you use the box then it sells overnight
[03:20] <taichouloki> because its right next to the farm?
[03:20] <russific> or you can just run to the shop and sell yourself
[03:21] <baconormeat> hei guys ,when is the bbest time to marry ??
[03:22] <herolake> never
[03:22] <baconormeat> LOL
[03:22] <baconormeat> why ??
[03:23] <scereno> "intelligent men don't get married"
[03:23] <foxy111> does this game have multiplayer?
[03:23] <baconormeat> : P
[03:23] <ankarius> KappaPride men don't get married too KappaPride
[03:24] <destiny_bot> Destiny has a new Twitter! twitter.com/OmniDestiny
[03:25] <its_ken> he dosnt Kappa
[03:25] <julien199877> pretty much
[03:25] <erkman143> reckful doesnt communicate with chat
[03:25] <esoterikk> Destiny Reckfuls chat is spam aids he doesn't really interact much
[03:25] <ashes2049> yeah just reads random shit whilst monologuing
[03:25] <mantheonthenippletwister> yup, picks a message from the spam and gets tilted
[03:25] <livewireetv> he talks to donators lol
[03:25] <jkww512> he usually doesnt talk to his chat
[03:25] <multix_gg> Sometimes he does, but mostly just the negative comments and gets depressed about it
[03:25] <brock4ever> sounds like senpai :(
[03:25] <verettv> random messages in the spam and donations @Destiny
[03:25] <vagrancy_en> Echo chamber communication
[03:25] <esoterikk> He just talks
[03:25] <moddit> he doesnt, all hearthstone streams are like tat, well all of the popular ones only
[03:25] <erkman143> he cant not with the amount of spam in his chat
[03:25] <yoloswagmeisterx420> He will randomly look at some chat but mostly just talks
[03:25] <ghostmylight> He somehow still reads a lot of messages in that chat
[03:25] <yura37> he picks out shit that rustles him mostly like you do destiny
[03:26] <esoterikk> Destiny he mostly just talks about how sad he is
[03:26] <ayeseven> he try to read whats the general chat is spamming
[03:26] <ankarius> He is talking about his gambling addiction all the time KappaPride
[03:26] <ashes2049> just thinks out loud i guess
[03:26] <yoloswagmeisterx420> idk i guess he is just an interesting guy
[03:26] <erkman143> he usually ends up responding to the spams most of the time
[03:26] <bananathugg> He talks about life and random shit alot
[03:26] <bananathugg> lol ya
[03:26] <liusslo> bombs are kinda bad, cause you lose ore drop from a nod
[03:26] <galaxy> bananathugg, who?
[03:27] <mantheonthenippletwister> yes
[03:27] <unclecolumbo> I've watched Reckful's stream a handful of times for about 20 minutes each and all I heard was him bitching about this or that. Money jealousies mostly.
[03:27] <multix_gg> Reckful is only entertaining when there is drama
[03:27] <bananathugg> Reckful talks about past stories alot
[03:27] <erkman143> there are days where he is boring. its usually when hes depressed and an emo cunt
[03:27] <esoterikk> Destiny he repeats himself a lot and mostly just talks about being sad
[03:27] <bananathugg> and when he has nothing to talk about he usually has a guest over to talk with
[03:27] <bananathugg> like one of his roomates or a random friend
[03:27] <zerghydra> he is never boring to me
[03:28] <liusslo> from what I saw, he is a cool guy
[03:28] <gawntlet> Destiny loved the laning phase of draven
[03:28] <westwilde> @Destiny, i'm curious, if you didn't stream, would you be playing this game still or games in general?
[03:28] <maturalgaming> @pacjax 2x Klappa
[03:29] <ankarius> Hoe dat sand for free items
[03:29] <liusslo> Ankarius, +1

[03:29] <thepolishdynasty> Destiny final thoughts on athene?!
[03:29] <rileyjoe32123> it ends at 120
[03:29] <unclecolumbo> Can you use the crafted stairs in these mines? @Destiny
[03:29] <ghostmylight> Bombs help
[03:29] <ankarius> You just have to buy 100-200 bombs from the dwarf and bomb everything into oblivion KappaPride
[03:30] <rileyjoe32123> you get a quest that says how deep dose it go
[03:30] <rileyjoe32123> there is another mine in the desert
[03:31] <unclecolumbo> That's the one he's in now.
[03:31] <icspark> do u drink mountain stardew
[03:31] <icspark> ??
[03:31] <unclecolumbo> Can you use the stairs in these mines?
[03:32] <unclecolumbo> The crafted ones.

[03:34] <gotta_draw> just buy salad
[03:34] <ninjabadgeer> Destiny, was the whole call with reckful even worth?
[03:34] <gotta_draw> you can make stairs to next level for 100 rocks
[03:34] <bananathugg> Of course it was worth. He got to leech a few viewers :^)

[03:35] <fappincow> what video are we talking about?
[03:35] <gawntlet> as an Accountant, I hate when people say "oh you must be good at math" 4Head . Accounting has no math
[03:35] <ninjabadgeer> bananathugg, that's my point it was like 3 hours of awkwardness for a few hundred viewers for a like 5 hours and maybe a few dozens of new followers
[03:35] <itsjustcrow> It's too bad I can't make my Division character look like Donald Trump
[03:35] <yura37> isnt that the only way to think about it?
[03:35] <bobdole0> but it has counting in the name
[03:36] <yura37> destiny how else do you think about it
[03:36] <bananathugg> Could have been more viewers if Destiny wasnt a Nazi LUL

[03:44] <sinik17> many viewbots
[03:44] <flashfit> In my heart you are destiny <3
[03:44] <beefcake18> MrDestructoid
[03:44] <papermashy> is the athene convo on a vod?
[03:44] <flashfit> last one
[03:45] <papermashy> thanks
[03:45] <julien199877> massan and athene MrDestructoid
[03:45] <revalence123> Like whats harder building an audience or tricking people into thinking they are joining an existing audience when viewbots are cheap
[03:45] <yura37> @slimyspartacus, dank layout
[03:45] <brock4ever> @sinik17 there's actually only 2 viewers here, me and you
[03:45] <sinik17> I'm just an advanced viewbot @Brock4ever
[03:45] <slimyspartacus> i didnt make that layout i found it on reddit
[03:45] <yura37> and all of these accounts are me
[03:46] <revalence123> Ok you know what I don't understand
[03:46] <slimyspartacus> heres one for the greenhouse
[03:46] <omi____> he modded his pigs
[03:46] <multix_gg> Viewbots are not an issue unless twitch admits its an issue
[03:46] <omi____> i did too lol
[03:46] <revalence123> they know when someone bots
[03:46] <ghostmylight> Twitch viewbots itself confirmed
[03:46] <revalence123> so why don't they just under the table adjust their views to make it accurate
[03:46] <crstyj> doesnt cranberry wine sell more than blueberry wine?
[03:46] <rhanza> lana Del Rey is hot MrDestructoid
[03:47] <eclips4x> Just got $600 tax return as an illegal immigrant boys. Obama actually gave me a legal status and I can actually work and have SSN
[03:47] <revalence123> Like that shouldn't be impossible no
[03:47] <brock4ever> thats something I've wondered as well @Revalence123
[03:47] <yura37> cranberries are better but destiny hates the color red Kappa
[03:47] <revalence123> Like it would make it so easy to just bust people down over time
[03:47] <blackjackaltv> gn chat
[03:47] <brock4ever> gn bb
[03:47] <lars018> thats what i wonder aswell inb4 twitch secretly sells viewers to high profile streamers the conspiracy!
[03:47] <revalence123> Se ya jackal
[03:47] <multix_gg> And if they admit there is issue with the viewbots, that will definately affect how advertizers will think about twitch and using it as a way to advertize as they mostly think that the viewers are actual people
[03:47] <yura37> gn bjTV
[03:47] <omi____> what are slimes even for? i have a slime hutch but
[03:48] <revalence123> I think Dansgameing is a bot
[03:48] <omi____> kripp is not viewbotting lmao what is he talking about
[03:48] <lets_frown> I came from Kripps stream PogChamp
[03:48] <brock4ever> I feel like most people that watch kripp watch him to laugh at his saltiness and criticize his plays
[03:48] <revalence123> If omi if is the key word
[03:48] <somebadkidtv> kripp has been streaming a long time
[03:48] <omi____> wow i havent watched destiny since 2011 but what is he talking about
[03:49] <flashfit> tuck frump
[03:49] <shorizor> trump is boring as hell
[03:49] <revalence123> Someone brought that up in his other chat
[03:49] <yura37> so you have no idea whats going on is what youre saying omi
[03:49] <flashfit> 100 viewbotting
[03:49] <lars018> i stopped watching kripp when he only started playing hearthstone and no arpgs anymore
[03:49] <ninjabadgeer> destiny is view botting for sure, look how slow this chat is ><>J
[03:49] <revalence123> LIke Idk when i see very generic or no personality streamers you have to wonder
[03:49] <bobdole0> if you're looking for a very serious stream with play by plays trump is one of the few hs streams there
[03:49] <revalence123> @NinjaBadgeer, OuO
[03:49] <multix_gg> I watch kripp when there is no one else to watch, EU timed streams suck ass
[03:50] <omi____> @Yura37 uh no the viewbot thing is twitch-wide
[03:50] <p0undcake> I made the mistake of watching the Reckful/Destiny vod last night before bed I didn't get any sleep, just got back from work now and I'm fucked.
[03:50] <cybercyb> how the fuck are they eu times, he finishes his stream about 10 am for me. (german)
[03:50] <revalence123> @omi____, its a troll mate
[03:50] <kizzu137> When are you gonna interrogate Athene you'd be the perfect person for it
[03:50] <somebadkidtv> i watched him more when he played diablo and poe.. hearthstone bores me
[03:50] <yura37> no you actually have no idea whats going on
[03:50] <frankerzrap> what game is this
[03:50] <brock4ever> he did interrogate him @Kizzu137 this morning
[03:50] <omi____> im saying he's clueless, kripp is not viewbotting lol destiny would be more likely to viewbot but i dont believe destiny is viewbotting either
[03:50] <inertpackage> what year season is this?
[03:50] <yura37> your comments are more understandable now
[03:50] <sinik17> but you'll know its not similar, youll know
[03:50] <frankerzrap> what game is this????
[03:51] <yura37> since youre clueless
[03:51] <kizzu137> Aw sheeeeee
[03:51] <frankerzrap> this looks cancerous lol
[03:51] <revalence123> Wait how is Destiny likely to viewbot
[03:51] <mom0momo> type !momolewds for anime girls being indecent
[03:51] <revalence123> He has two chats
[03:51] <revalence123> both active
[03:51] <revalence123> like WutFace

[03:52] <ixpellia> MASSAN BANNED PogChamp
[03:52] <omi____> before you said "if he's viewbotting etc.." you said "i think so too" to the viewer that commented
[03:52] <willdamm> nooob
[03:52] <erkman143> MASSAN BANNED PogChamp
[03:52] <sinik17> cuck pos, lol
[03:52] <shorizor> looool
[03:52] <rhanza> who says noob unironically these days
[03:52] <revalence123> @Destiny, yo who do you think is viewbotting besides athene and massan
[03:52] <eclips4x> SwiftRage cuck pos
[03:52] <somebadkidtv> so what is this game? just farming?
[03:52] <ghostmylight> Kripp bought gold out of game during his d3 inferno push its not like he's never done anything sketchy. But I don't think he bots
[03:52] <notgoob> @Omi____ he doesnt read this chat
[03:52] <revalence123> that are large streamers that is
[03:52] <yura37> @MoM0MoMo, all chat lewds WutFace
[03:52] <yura37> OuO
[03:52] <omi____> @Notgoob he just read my whole comment out loud bro you're clueless too FailFish
[03:53] <gotta_draw> why do people care so much about candy crush streamers
[03:53] <koshirikdo> Came for the farm, stayed for the drama
[03:53] <salamanca32> Hai MoMo OuO
[03:53] <sinik17> I'm fairly certain that he's going to hate those fences about 6 hours from now
[03:53] <jewfro_1995> Krip is a enjoyable streamer in my opinion, the only bad thing is that it's hearthstone everyday which after while it just gets old watching night after night
[03:53] <ordinarybox> what's happening? who's viewbotting?
[03:53] <ixpellia> destiny does read this chat....sometimes FeelsBadMan
[03:53] <sinik17> they break so fucking often
[03:53] <revalence123> @omi____, it was a response to something someone said in his other chat and he made it clear by saying IF HE WAS
[03:53] <omi____> this chat though
[03:53] <notbeef> hi
[03:53] <omi____> EleGiggle
[03:53] <r00gle> i personally doubt there is a wide spread viewbotting problem under the top streamers it is most likely the middle (100 to 999 viewers) that are viewbotting
[03:53] <revalence123> Your brain doe EleGiggle
[03:53] <erkman143> omi ur pathetic
[03:53] <eclips4x> People argue if Destiny even reads this chat FeelsBadMan
[03:54] <brock4ever> Kripp is really not enjoyable at all to me. His saltiness was funny the first ten minutes, then it was every opponent being lucky, topdecking, or being unskilled. Ridiculous to watch.
[03:54] <notbeef> Steven
[03:54] <destiny_bot> Destiny updates YouTube regularly now! "Discussing flat tax with a caller" posted 12h 54m ago youtu.be/OeZmoxpLUPc
[03:54] <omi____> oh look he just read another comment from this thread
[03:54] <qualitybad> winter BrokeBack
[03:54] <revalence123> I think its a top meme cause he doesn't often you can ride it off that he doesn't
[03:54] <notgoob> he usually doesnt
[03:54] <omi____> this chat is clueless af 4Head
[03:54] <jlpc0bra> density is ashamed of this chat. we're like his retarded son
[03:54] <trichometrent> LOL
[03:54] <punisher_2003> stickyrice 4Head
[03:54] <revalence123> but I feel like an ass now cause he does when its good FeelsBadMan
[03:54] <salamanca32> luxxGasm MoMo
[03:54] <1barrygreen> So what is your position on athene atm? Do you still think hes guilty @Destiny
[03:54] <notgoob> I mean his title the other day even referenced his chat being on .gg
[03:54] <salamanca32> luxxLewd
[03:54] <mom0momo> hi Salamanca32
[03:54] <julien199877> ... and massan/athene EleGiggle
[03:54] <gotta_draw> masan viewbots, plenty of evidence
[03:54] <greypilgrim> I see he is still playing this 12 year old game
[03:54] <ixpellia> need MOAR MMOMO lewds OuO
[03:54] <eclips4x> We're called clueless for being 90% correct FeelsBadMan
[03:55] <ninjabadgeer> nice farm going on ther buddy
[03:55] <mom0momo> im sorry
[03:55] <sinik17> lots of counting in this stream
[03:55] <revalence123> 1BarryGreen Fuck man you are late to the party
[03:55] <ninjabadgeer> pretty neat KKona
[03:55] <louder_howard> 1barrygreen he said he was satisfied with athene's answers
[03:55] <brock4ever> Look at stickyrice1 - a cs streamer who burst out into streaming averaging around 2k viewbotted viewers. Now that the drama around him died down, he averages around 1.5k and makes tons of money. Viewbotting is worth it.
[03:55] <mom0momo> that lewd was not suppose to be in all chat
[03:55] <mom0momo> :s
[03:55] <ghostmylight> It means so much to be in the top page or 2 on the channel list
[03:55] <revalence123> LOL
[03:55] <shorizor> FeelsBadMan we are adopted
[03:55] <1barrygreen> alright thanks
[03:55] <ixpellia> 4Head
[03:55] <revalence123> Its ok Momo
[03:55] <revalence123> It was a dank lewd
[03:55] <ixpellia> more "accident" lewds OuO
[03:55] <gotta_draw> sprinklers stack
[03:55] <sinik17> What's his on screen chat? Sub only chat?
[03:55] <brock4ever> destiny.gg
[03:55] <revalence123> If you are an Sc2 streamer only you have to
[03:55] <jlpc0bra> destiny.gg
[03:55] <brock4ever> his chat there
[03:55] <jewfro_1995> Lmao that is true but him raging about that is pretty much
[03:56] <sinik17> Ah thanks
[03:56] <revalence123> Yea thats his other chat
[03:56] <revalence123> its open to anyone
[03:56] <gotta_draw> put floor under your sprinklers so you don't knock em out with your hoe
[03:56] <brock4ever> dont go there
[03:56] <brock4ever> too memey
[03:56] <arclitetanksc> destiny, why don't you viewbot?
[03:56] <mom0momo> How is Destiny able to run this farm by himself?
[03:56] <jlpc0bra> i went there and came out with cancer and aids
[03:56] <revalence123> Because he isn't a shit lord
[03:56] <mom0momo> why doesnt he hire Mexicans to help him?
[03:56] <revalence123> PogChamp
[03:56] <sinik17> this is post trump america
[03:57] <graysonparkerr> @destiny the sprinklers stack in your inventory
[03:57] <jewfro_1995> Is this game ever going to come out on console?
[03:57] <ixpellia> he read twtich chat again PogChamp
[03:57] <ninjabadgeer> as long you say destiny on your message he will likely read it
[03:57] <r00gle> it is not unfeasable to make a perfect viewbot that also follows on twitter and youtube the captcha's that are in place on those services can be cheaply solved by chinese sweatshop workers (3 bucks for 1000 capcha solves)
[03:58] <grandmasterzerg1> destiny have you played day 9s rts, Atlas?
[03:58] <revalence123> Momo I raise your race meme to with a ghetto meme http://imgur.com/EX7uM3e
[03:58] <gaymingwithmolt> @destiny where is your slave labor?
[03:58] <shyluvu> bad place
[03:58] <saintbeastie> @destiny is there a renewable way to farm hardened wood?
[03:58] <eclips4x> Day9 FeelsBadMan
[03:58] <shyluvu> if you want the mega melons/pumpkins
[03:58] <revalence123> I miss Day9
[03:58] <jeaddie> if someone had a millino viewbots watcing a stream would twitch take it down? because if that happened they would have to admit viewbotting is real right?
[03:58] <revalence123> We need im back in the Sc2 memes
[03:59] <brock4ever> hell you dont even need chinese captcha workers, you can use something like amazon mturk to get people to make fake accounts and shit for you
[03:59] <trichometrent> lol revalence i like that 1 :D
[03:59] <revalence123> Jeaddie nobody is stupid enough to do that though
[03:59] <ixpellia> patrick penis
[03:59] <sinik17> @Saintbeastie I think there's a lumberjack perk that gives hardened wood with normal trees

[04:20] <linoleumknife> its around there
[04:20] <issashine> Football_Coach, he is just my friend wtf why would i want you to say sexual stuff.. i just wanna get him something thats like typical america and funny...
[04:20] <linoleumknife> big macs are gross and small now though
[04:21] <zytral> @Destiny, i guess its kinda confusing to me because of all the videos i have seen can you give an up to date statement about what you think about the athene situation
[04:21] <kotourachan> destiny two people can easily do well on a med pop server. The game is basically an extended version of agario :) I think u'd like it
[04:22] <frost_420> hold on to them they go up after awhile some of the cases are worth a couple bucks
[04:22] <animal_libera> If you are looking to get stuffed at mc donalds you'll have to pay at least 15$
[04:22] <animal_libera> in norway
[04:22] <animal_libera> unless you stack them cheeseburgers
[04:22] <football_coach> Hhhehehe
[04:22] <linoleumknife> 5guys for about 4 bucks is all you need.
[04:22] <firesleeper> destiny how high of rank do you aim for in cs?
[04:22] <kotourachan> how much would get you stuffed? A cheeseburger+coke+fries is good for me and thats cheap as dirt
[04:22] <brock4ever> everybody new in chat, turn down your stream volume. Destiny tends to scream during cs
[04:23] <salamanca32> What? No way Destiny. A noob can break in into any base. It's just takes longer, every building has a durability. Weakest bases are made out of wood. Which of bases are made of. It's fair that you may not want to play it but Rust is fun. It's what you wanted out of the minecraft server you hosted.
[04:23] <football_coach> Brock4ever, maybe he won't this match, i'll just turn my volume up even more FeelsGoodMan
[04:23] <animal_libera> Decent burger as in quarter pounder or better+fries
[04:23] <brock4ever> @Football_coach kek
[04:23] <liusslo> Kotourachan, eating junk for like 10$ is never "correct" :P
[04:23] <animal_libera> though fries are much smaller here though
[04:23] <kotourachan> that's what im saying salamanca

[04:26] <issashine> >everyone said two years ago that my skin from two years ago was really expensive LUL
[04:26] <kotourachan> if ur hungry and are lazy ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[04:26] <brock4ever> he doesnt understand proper money management in the game so he just buys whatever

[04:39] <soulstakertv> aim head my friend
[04:39] <daironlung> the tapping is fine at that distance, he just needs to pull his aim further down for the recoil

[04:47] <brock4ever> Lol
[04:47] <papermashy> slaughter
[04:47] <drakojn> what's the chat on left about?
[04:47] <gagesin8> hey use g4g so we can donate also to charity~!
[04:47] <mooseferret> Prerecorded
[04:47] <twick2gee> those are the viewers he likes Kappa
[04:47] <brock4ever> Pre recorded stream
[04:47] <drakojn> oh
[04:48] <johnspecter> EU = ANELE
[04:48] <brock4ever> Basically he is doing the Athens method of spectating rather than playing games
[04:48] <papermashy> why doesn't destiny have a box explaining about his website and the other chat underneath?
[04:48] <pynkoqt> so destiny got rekt yesterday by athene?
[04:48] <brock4ever> Athene method I mean
[04:49] <twick2gee> alot of us watch him everyday so the regulars already know what that chat is
[04:49] <drakojn> why would he got rekt by athene?
[04:49] <johnspecter> Most of Destiny's viewers have been watching for a very long time.
[04:49] <thaonliwun> LOL
[04:49] <mindestroyer> VAC GabeN
[04:49] <papermashy> Just seems needlessly confusing to new viewers though no?
[04:49] <lanolinlol> GabeN thats a ban
[04:49] <scereno> We're the atrophied husks that survive through destinys copious amounts of autism. Leave while you can
[04:50] <pokebrah> what the fuck is WIZDSLAY?
[04:50] <drakojn> i am sharing this account with my brother he watches destiny but after he skyped with reckful i thought he's a very smart and cool guy so here i am :D
[04:50] <drakojn> this is the first time i am watching a prerecorded stream tbh
[04:50] <papermashy> nice meme
[04:51] <brock4ever> Just pretend it's youtube
[04:51] <brock4ever> That's what I do
[04:51] <drakojn> btw what happened between destiny and athene i know he talked about athene with reckful but nothing more
[04:52] <papermashy> hopefully he will upload the athene chat to his YT
[04:52] <t0rst3n> its up, but on LiveStrums youtube
[04:52] <brock4ever> Athene just explained himself and destiny concluded that his donation platform is legit probably
[04:52] <scrubbington> stream keeeps freezing for me
[04:53] <drakojn> how can it be legit when the shown resources and companies are non-existing
[04:53] <drakojn> or maybe the ones i read about were hater posts
[04:53] <drakojn> dunnp
[04:54] <brock4ever> He showed his donation page so he definitely received the money

[17:51] <zardthebraveking> Just watched todays Forsen dramma... his main argument seems to be Athene just bet ALL HIS REPUTATION on obviously botting himself. But it actually doesnt make sense cuz Athene has been building so much stuff and projects related to the charity.. at this context such a bet doesnt worth it. +Athene is using now all the dramma cuz Forsen created it and Athene has to deal with it the best he can (promoting g4g). BibleThump the dramma..

[20:14] <akademiker> negroid is the race
[20:14] <izzyftw> @Agamer1992, someone was asking why they say African American instead of blac. I was just saying they say it for political correctness.
[20:14] <bucknut27> what is the political chat on screen?
[20:14] <flawless1111> I'm not actually black so I don't know how relevant my take on this is, but I feel like I would be more offended by "African American" than by black.

[20:16] <eckozero> you dont need to buy the recipe at al, if you have the ingredients and know which icon the food is, you can just craft it by clicking it
[20:16] <cern33> @akademiker lol maybe according to "race scientists" in the 1890s
[20:16] <meltinthesun> If a news show said "afro american voters" it would be a shit storm

[20:17] <kanring> @AAPNet I know some good muslims. They didnt cause the SJW frenzy. It has been in place since the 80's. But it doesnt help that all immigrants are left as fuck. And their votes matter nowadays, so it'll be hard to get a rightist goverment in place now

[20:19] <omnomnomberry> @bucknut27 that's not banned in general

[20:19] <cern33> people in the Caucusus mountains supposedly had the best characteristics of the white race. good breeding stock
[20:19] <qtssss> Like I'm calling it, the civil war of Sweden is fucking arriving sooner than people think, I bet

[20:20] <infamousxreflex> destiny.gg
[20:20] <shadakh> @akademiker yeah and peoples way of labelling it is so stupid. Like apparently Obama is the first "African american" president when he has as much white genetic material in him as black
[20:20] <nikku_5> Yeah guys he cant read this chat
[20:20] <ecomattis> apparently it's suppose to be randomly dropped by rabbits destiny
[20:20] <aapnet> I mean don't get me wrong Christians are crazy, but Muslims are 1000x more of a problem
[20:20] <meltinthesun> Its not the immigrants causing the problems with SJW in Sweden. Its the left wing people indoctrinating the people because they can convice lots of people with emotional irrational arguments
[20:20] <gnavon> Atraedies, do you have an accent
[20:20] <ecomattis> holy shit im so fkin slow
[20:20] <immortalbio> I can't believe he is playing this meme game
[20:20] <akademiker> @destiny mummies drop rabbit legs
[20:21] <simoneriksson87> Destiny seen the save the children proof video?
[20:21] <qtssss> @AAPNet when you believe in some fucking toilet paper scroll that some pothead wrote 3000 years ago things becomes problematic
[20:21] <agamer1992> @bucknut27 why ? at some point your ancestors where refugees
[20:21] <meltinthesun> They get huge media attention with they whine about racist etc when in reality its not racism
[20:21] <bucknut27> no they werent
[20:21] <kanring> Meltinthesun: Yea, Immigrants in politics are almost non-existent compated to ethnic swedes.
[20:21] <bucknut27> they were legal immigrants
[20:21] <multix_gg> Himmler said that Hitler didnt do the holocaust, must be solid proof
[20:21] <cern33> @kanring nah im white. english/scottish/dutch mostly. live in Ohio
[20:21] <akademiker> @agamer1992 wrong, they were mostly settlers
[20:21] <louder_howard> Simoneriksson87 he retweeted it
[20:21] <gangsta_yolo_swag> wow
[20:21] <lumpenprole> wow
[20:21] <blackjackaltv> Wow
[20:21] <bradbot> mom
[20:21] <gangsta_yolo_swag> oh wow
[20:22] <gangsta_yolo_swag> kaceyW
[20:22] <bucknut27> also when people talk about refugees they generally mean the hate mongering non conforming pieces of shit that come out of the desert
[20:22] <shadakh> @meltinthesun even though I agree with you unfortunately the left hasn't been the only one to make emotional irrational arguments. Arguably the reason the current Islamic immigration problem isn't being tackled more readily right now, is because every previous wave of immigration had the same far right fucktards saying the immigrants would ruin the country, which inevitably didn't happen

[20:23] <qtssss> @Meltinthesun Actually, political corectness is the problem. People refuse to notice the flaws within the system, that immigrants causes more problem especially people from Moroco, Somalia, etc. and there are to be found statistics proving this. Yet people don't want to take knowledge of this as everything is considered racist. Vote SD 2018.

Big parts of of migrants that came with the previous waves were either labor migrants of academics running away from the islamisation of the middle east. The people who are coming now are uneducated and basically war-torn
[20:24] <radicality5> @HotshortsGG, he's actually one of the more healthy candidates.
[20:24] <mister_toast> why watch super tuesday when u can watch super tuesday with duck noises in the background
[20:24] <ironchieftain> Sanders is 5 years older than Trump, 6 years older than Hillary. Hillary is 68, Trump is 69
[20:24] <qtssss> Bernie Sanders is 74, so doubt it
[20:24] <mivenku> Infamousxreflex He has LESS THAN 1% chance of winning michigan
[20:24] <multix_gg> Because we have to be tolerant and help those who are hateful, even if it would be the doom of the society as we know it
[20:24] <midnight_ahri> who got michigan, i missed it
[20:24] <bucknut27> bernie could never win cause socialism only works until you run out of other peoples money

[20:27] <cern33> thats it
[20:27] <football_coach> Bucknut27, are you EU?
[20:27] <flawless1111> @Shadakh Honestly I think the problem is that the people who complained about immigration in the 80s in Sweden were pretty much nazis, so there's a consensus that people who compain today are racist now too. Even though the situation is completely different
[20:27] <meltinthesun> @QTSSSS, dont think he reads this chat. He has his own site with chat on destiny dot gg
[20:27] <shadakh> @flawless1111 while that is likely true (even though the reunification of Europe post cold war and the influx of Indian migrants were pretty big cultural clashes too) it seems likely that the amount of times the right has died wolf on immigration has just left people unable to recognise the danger of the current lot
[20:27] <multix_gg> @simoneriksson87, please, ive been around athene while you were still trollin on the WoW forums
[20:27] <kriswithak502> do 15 pushups

[20:28] <rockleespartan> he reads chat, but only if you're being super autistic and insulting him at the same time Kappa

[20:28] <bucknut27> USA
[20:28] <shadakh> @flawless1111 yeah though I think that attitude is changing thanks to this crisis. Any Swedish person I know is really pissed off at the current refugee situation, they want literally everything else about Sweden to stay the same, but no more refugees
[20:28] <digbick99> i also forgot how grammar works today
[20:28] <qtssss> @Digbick99 I'm in the same seat right here

[20:30] <cern33> hes the gov of ohio btw

[20:30] <aapnet> gerrymandering basically handed republicans the House of Representitives
[20:30] <aidaders> Make Donald drumf again
[20:30] <meltinthesun> What makes me angry is that the big parties in sweden are excluding SD and justify it by saying "oh they are racist so its ok". Its so undemocratic and thats why im gonna vote for them
[20:30] <kappastr0ng> Plot twist Trump makes 15% off of negative attack ads against him. #rigged or #smart =)
[20:30] <pikameeka> Real talk, does duck mayonnaise exist?

[20:31] <bucknut27> he will be the best jobs president since WW2
[20:31] <akademiker> @flawless1111 if you are white and rich you can buy russian citizenship
[20:31] <aapnet> @QTSSSS, good luck in the SJW hellhole that is Sweden
[20:31] <shadakh> @meltinthesun what needs to happen is, some of the major left parties need to change policy on immigration. Any one that does will grab the popular vote by a landslide if the others don't. Europeans generally don't want right wing governments, but the migration crisis is pushing them that way because there isn't enough options on the left to stop it. Which sucks, obviously
[20:31] <vintagez> trump doesn't say a damn thing that's true, outside of wanting to date his own duaghter
[20:31] <bittie> How do you use your bed? I cant go to sleep on Stardew valley. :(

[20:32] <qtssss> @AAPNet yeah, fuck those and their political corectness. A girl in my school was like "I follow what is political correct" and I laughed her right in the face and told her she was an idiot. #Swedish #Proud
[20:32] <mirchtv> @destiny can you give some closure to the whole athene drama? i just came from youtube and watched the vod
[20:33] <doyouwannabuild> is this msnbc?

[20:33] <pokename144> he is so ugly
[20:33] <doyouwannabuild> tnx
[20:33] <qtssss> @AAPNet Sweden is tbh such a coward country. No one dares to speak their mind. That's actually one thing I like about Trump, even though I don't support some of his ideas, I like that he dares to speak his mind.
[20:33] <akademiker> @flawless1111 then you best build a vault
[20:33] <steinuh> He was ready Kappa
[20:34] <roivas1> athene AngelThump
[20:34] <aapnet> @QTSSSS, they are the reason Trump is winning in the US, people are tired of people being politically correct and SJW, and Trump is the opposite
[20:34] <meltinthesun> @Shadakh, Depends. Im more towards the right so i dont mind the left losing votes. What is happening now tho is the right parties becoming more like the left and the left parties becoming more like the right. They align in the middle which is troubblig. That and also excluding the 3rd biggest party is just making it more and more undemocratic

[20:34] <xkeebzz> what about the viewbots?
[20:34] <erode123> MasSan was the same way though FeelsBadMan
[20:34] <qtssss> @AAPNet I think that politicans that dare to speak their mind makes them viable as a strong leader
[20:34] <digbick99> i dont like trump whatsoever, but i do respect that he just doesnt give a shit
[20:34] <shadakh> @flawless1111 I presume the crisis must be a massive pain in the ass for you too so? Given that some retards are going to be pissed at anyone who isn't white, even if they are properly integrated swedes who aren't in an islamicised ghetto :/
[20:35] <cerebellum42> you mean to say "candidates that make it seem like they are speaking their mind convincingly"
[20:35] <rockleespartan> she didn't say "Flint Water Crisis" enough in her debate
[20:35] <cern33> the thing about hands is that if your ring finger is longer than your index finger it means you have higher testosterone
[20:35] <akademiker> Kreygasm born just in time to witness the genocide of muslims in europe Kreygasm
[20:35] <digbick99> correct
[20:35] <aapnet> @QTSSSS, yeah, they lobbying in the US has destroyed any politicians ability to speak their mind in the US
[20:35] <qtssss> Although when Trump says that "Muslims/Immigrants are a threat to the country" it's so disgusting to hear. But the thing is, he's right fucking spot on about it. Just look at media in Sweden and Germany and look how fucked up it's.
[20:35] <thatoneabiss> @akademiker same
[20:36] <natescott430> Just like how you respect the idiot that blasts his music in crowded public areas. The "doesn't give a fuck" attitude is shitty and obnoxious.
[20:36] <aapnet> Bernie and trump are the only ones not taking shit from the Lobbyists
[20:36] <qtssss> @AAPNet yeah, even though media is trying to shit talk Trump, I love that he stands up for what he thinks.

[20:38] <mercilexe> WTF. Why is he not voting?!
[20:38] <bucknut27> its fact
[20:38] <flawless1111> @Shadakh yeah, I'm kind of caught in the crossfire even though I'm not part of the problem. Both my parents are doctors and I was raised in a upper-middle class regular swedish neighbourhood, and all my friends are white swedes obviously. But when people who share my skin color come here and rape people, it indirectly affects me and my family since the prejudice against people who aren't white increases. Also, it's not like my sister is immune to the rapists either

[20:43] <flawless1111> @Snubbnzakk The way the popular parties are handing the current migration wave is terrible since it increases segregation in the society. I really believe that everyone migrating to the country should adapt to the swedish society and swedish values (just like my parents/grandparents did). But while I think the current parties are handling the migration like shit, I don't think SD is the right answer either. I'm kind of politically homeless

[20:46] <flawless1111> @Meltinthesun Also there's the fact that I don't agree with SD on anything other than the migration. I think their stances on pretty much every other subject is the opposite of what i think
[20:47] <bucknut27> think of the memes if you all vote trump http://i.imgur.com/hpqlG0V.jpg

[20:47] <nikku_5> @Aapnet Polls are meaningless to me, the only thing that matters is who actually is the winner in the end.
[20:47] <lagrizle> Straw poll that shit
[20:47] <infamousxreflex> like EVE would have a high income?
[20:47] <bucknut27> she wont (unless trump gets elected) but any other soilder would have been taken to milotary court for it
[20:47] <meltinthesun> @Flawless1111, yeah i mean its not a perfect scenario for me either regarding my political thoughts. But its better than the altenatives. Sucks but its the truth
[20:47] <aapnet> @Nikku_5, than how can you say bernie loses to trump???
[20:47] <meltinthesun> for me atleast
[20:47] <rockleespartan> wow, you're right, clearly the only reason to vote is for the memes, I'll definitely vote trump now

[21:35] <bucknut27> trump polls well in up state new york and employs a lot of new yorkers
[21:35] <strikereternal> sanders' policies are social democrat though, regardless of what he calls himself
[21:35] <samharley42> I'm lucky enough to have a few Muslim friends. They are all very kind and horrified at what they hear about back in their home countries
[21:35] <okfloorit> BouncerBenjamin, 90% is not fact.
[21:35] <satipler1234> if trump doesnt win new york I'll get a sex change operation

[21:40] <rockleespartan> @Infamousxreflex you have any predictions, cause i can't imagine any republican supporting trump past chris
[21:40] <samharley42> As for the "most muslims are extremists," this is not so much a product of beliefs of even Islam, but groups such as ISIS that force such practice on innocent people
[21:40] <ivantavarez> ;) WOW
[21:40] <mindestroyer> WOW ;)
[21:40] <okfloorit> BouncerBenjamin, Bernie wants to give people a fighting chance who don't normally have that opportunity. You're spoiled enough to have to worry about shit like taxes where certain people are worried about if they get cancer are they going to get medical attention you fucking twat.
[21:40] <yura37> im voting trump
[21:40] <themartyraion> they rape those girls for days and weeks
[21:40] <bouncerbenjamin> @Aapnet Did you watch the last debate! He said on stage he wants to strengthen the shrinking middle class please look it up. Thats all Bernie voters say is that we dont understand Democratic socialism

[21:41] <faddaaa> @SamHarley42, nobody reasonable says that all muslims are extremists. What people are expressing are fears of being raped and supressed like we can see in Germany on lot's of occasions
[21:41] <yura37> @DESTINY MISSED SUB REEEEEEEEEEEEE
[21:41] <zongopbongo> SamHarley42 "most muslims are extremists" seems to be propagated and extrapolated using isis as the basemark

[21:44] <potioncellar> Did Destiny go get food? OnO
[21:44] <faddaaa> @SamHarley42, I agree that individuals should be treated as such. But seeing the society shift right now after the mass immigration of muslims with crime epidemics we never experienced before is a big concern for lot's of germans. People see how countrys with a muslim majority function and the weak in these societys are fucked (children, women, seniors, christians..)
[21:44] <gnavon> yes PotionCellar

[21:45] <bouncerbenjamin> @Okfloorit WAIT WAIT So making the government spend more money of free things when we are in debt is somehow going to help the national debt and its actually around 20 trillion mate

[21:45] <gnavon> no cam
[21:45] <ivansc2> someone convince me not to buy division
[21:45] <lagrizle> no mods
[21:45] <lagrizle> GG
[21:45] <bouncerbenjamin> @Okfloorit What!
[21:46] <lepoopeater> hi jerma
[21:46] <zervaldo> Ivansc2 it's repetetive and dull
[21:46] <samharley42> @Faddaaa I know the world doesn't work like that all the time, but what do we stand for if we don't try
[21:46] <a_microbiologist> how has still not noticed the host..
[21:46] <radzok> Why does this guy have a duck face?
[21:46] <fyrjefe> I missing the Destiny memes already. oh well
[21:46] <tizzit_gaming> Nice memes haHAA
[21:46] <aapnet> @BouncerBenjamin, if we TAX people equally, especially the rich, then yes we can afford free systems
[21:46] <helloyellofello> no trump im out.
[21:46] <bouncerbenjamin> @Okfloorit My logic is increasing taxes and spending money we don't have is only going to hurt the economy and the people
[21:46] <okfloorit> BouncerBenjamin, Out of money in 50 years, Already out of money- so how does that make sense.
[21:46] <lepoopeater> Radzok do you like kim kardashian?
[21:46] <akademiker> @samharley42 we wont, 80% of them are 20+ and can't read
[21:46] <destiny_bot> Remember to use Destiny's Amazon referral link! destiny.gg/amazon
[21:46] <lagrizle> Sounds good to me
[21:46] <esoterikk> @zervaldo, is it?
[21:47] <okfloorit> BouncerBenjamin, BY THAT SAME LOGIC, how would Trump generate ANY growth without spending money?! I could say the same thing.
[21:47] <samharley42> @Akademiker But they will have children, and they're children will have children, etc
[21:47] <faddaaa> @SamHarley42, who is going to help them integrate? the state departments are overworked, lots of immigrants don't show the will to learn the language or respect our freedoms we fought hard for. Nobody is going to adress these concerns and these are objective observations, not right wing propaganda as it is painted by the media
[21:47] <zervaldo> Esoterikk from what i've seen. 3 different kinds of missions and retarded AI
[21:47] <radzok> @Lepoopeater I mean she's attractive but kind of like a clown you want to ignore
[21:47] <aapnet> @BouncerBenjamin, you know that if rich people payed even close to even taxes of the middle class we would have more than trillions left over to fund government paid systems
[21:47] <lepoopeater> yea
[21:47] <bouncerbenjamin> @Aapnet You keep saying tax people equally do you know how taxes work now!? People who make above a certain amount the same percentage of taxes
[21:47] <lexneminis> im german FeelsBadMan last year i was really proud of my modern country right now im feeling really down when i think about our society on both sides of the spectrum theres so much BS FeelsBadMan
[21:48] <akademiker> @samharley42 we are talking about sub IQ 80 people, which is average in middle east. Most of them are borderline retsrded
[21:48] <samharley42> @Faddaaa Thats another great point. I suppose it has to be average citizens. The alternative of leaving them all to die seems far worse than any effort to help, though
[21:48] <lepoopeater> yeah someone that supported the Soviet Union won michigan
[21:48] <okfloorit> BouncerBenjamin, Idk why I'm arguing with you I'm out lol- It gets us nowhere.
[21:48] <gnavon> nathanDubs1 nathanDubs2 nathanDubs3
[21:48] <esoterikk> Holy shit I just noticed Division already has a 60$ fucking season pass rofl
[21:48] <esoterikk> nevermind
[21:48] <potioncellar> Yeah, that shit is expensive @Esoterikk
[21:48] <zervaldo> Esoterikk yeah, first 2 updates are free. and xboxone gets them 1 month before pc lol
[21:48] <bouncerbenjamin> @Okfloorit Im just asking please dont vote for Bernie they all suck but he will hurt this country down the road
[21:48] <lexneminis> Seasopn pass for cosmetic DLCs i bet LUL
[21:48] <samharley42> @Akademiker Thats what happens when people aren't educated. And when you judge people by innate qualities like IQs as defined by western standards, the data means nothing
[21:48] <faddaaa> @SamHarley42, you can't just start a big experiment like merkel did and think everything is going to be ok. You risk everything we achived over several hundreds of years (reforms, seculare state..) if you fail. Not even speaking about future klimate refugees
[21:49] <aapnet> @BouncerBenjamin, have you heard of captial gains?
[21:49] <aapnet> capital
[21:49] <esoterikk> yeah around,140$ CAD for a game is too much for me @PotionCellar
[21:49] <lepoopeater> bernie is a racist
[21:49] <lexneminis> yeah Faddaaa
[21:49] <okfloorit> BouncerBenjamin, I would disagree- I'd rather have Bernie than a Hate Mongering tyrant who is willing to fuck the US's foreign ties.
[21:49] <potioncellar> Yeahhhh, I don't blame you :( @Esoterikk
[21:49] <lepoopeater> that admired a country that killed over 10 million of its own citizens
[21:49] <lucratius> Wow, this Jerma dude seems like a swell fellow jermaMoon
[21:49] <akademiker> @samharley42 we already have problems with second generation muslims. All the rape you read on news was commited by them.
[21:49] <zervaldo> ResidentSleeper
[21:49] <samharley42> @Faddaaa We need our best and brightest on these issues, definitely. But time is not allowing the best situation for us to accept these people to ever be a possibility
[21:49] <lagrizle> I cant take it im out
[21:50] <lexneminis> im gonna follow this dude he seems chill FeelsGoodMan
[21:50] <samharley42> @Akademiker I think you need to check your facts there.
[21:50] <esoterikk> Looks like Division only has 80k Players on PC right now anyway
[21:50] <bouncerbenjamin> @Okfloorit Keep in mind these are countries that know we are led by morons and are taking advantage of us
[21:50] <lepoopeater> CHYNA
[21:50] <faddaaa> @SamHarley42, there is no ceiling for migration if we don't change our policy... if we don't moderatae it, there won't be the Germany left t hat can burden the financial expenses
[21:50] <bobthedoc> yep
[21:50] <bobthedoc> i completly agree
[21:50] <samharley42> I gtg guys, hope the discussion goes well.
[21:50] <bobthedoc> NO
[21:50] <bobthedoc> u stay
[21:50] <okfloorit> BouncerBenjamin, LOL?! I'm done. There was nothing factual about what you just said.
[21:50] <aapnet> @BouncerBenjamin, rich people abuse the fuck out of capital gains so they dont have to pay taxes on the property and bonds and stocks and make money off it and dont get punished
[21:50] <zervaldo> .. just look at the reviews on steam for the division, says alot right there
[21:50] <samharley42> I'm sure you can more or less assume my moral standpoint and apprehension
[21:50] <samharley42> g'night
[21:50] <kane2013> Faddaaa ahh the great experiment helping people in need, let them die!
[21:50] <lepoopeater> AAPNet are you for that beyond retarded FTT tax?
[21:51] <bouncerbenjamin> @Aapnet At the start of this I said that mate. I said no matter what you do to end tax loopholes people will move their money so it can't get taxed
[21:51] <gnavon> anyone wanna play counter strike while we wait for senpai to get back?
[21:51] <akademiker> @samharley42 cologne rape was second generation muslims, rape in austrian sauna was second generation muslim, murder of that swedish girl was second generation muslim
[21:51] <zervaldo> Gnavon sure
[21:51] <gnavon> zervaldo, you NA?
[21:52] <zervaldo> Gnavon no, eu pleb. but i can play on na ping huehue
[21:52] <zethau> AAPNet, but they need as much money as they can get so they can create jobs Kappa
[21:52] <pacjax> is destiny coming back?
[21:52] <faddaaa> @Kane2013, that's not what i stand for, but you can't just open the borders, not for refugees but for economy migrants too. Your risk destroying your economy and in the long term you can't save a single refugee anymore
[21:52] <akademiker> we failed to integrate muslims and now we pay the price
[21:52] <lexneminis> destiny left us forever and always FeelsBadMan
[21:52] <gnavon> which country are you from zervaldo?
[21:52] <zervaldo> Gnavon sweden
[21:52] <kane2013> Faddaaa criminals are criminals.....
[21:52] <gnavon> sweden has really good internet, no?
[21:53] <zervaldo> well yeah. but i still get around 150ms to the us
[21:53] <aapnet> @BouncerBenjamin, so we punish the people moving their money, they dont even have any sort of punishment
[21:53] <teemers> wtf this isnt destiny
[21:53] <bouncerbenjamin> @Aapnet But how are you going to punish if the money isn't in this country
[21:53] <aapnet> @BouncerBenjamin, slap them with extra taxes on the money they dont move to make up for it
[21:53] <akademiker> also christian refugees get stabbed by muslim refugees in the camps, because muslims are shit people
[21:53] <zervaldo> akademiker #notallmuslims
[21:53] <faddaaa> OK, I invite everybody to visit me in Berlin and we make a small tour with public transportation for everyone that believes we should take in more migrants...you will be surprised how much our culture profited in the last couple month..
[21:53] <lexneminis> Im living in Germany FeelsBadMan At least I have a house with windowshutters FeelsGoodMan
[21:54] <akademiker> @zervaldo #noneofthechristians
[21:54] <zervaldo> akademiker i live in a heavily segregated area south of stockholm, i know the pain.
[21:55] <akademiker> people tend to forget islam never had a reformation like christianity. islam is still stuck in the mindset of thr middle ages
[21:56] <aapnet> ^
[21:56] <faddaaa> @zervaldo, it's funny that people who encounter islam daily have a problem with said cummity..
[21:56] <aapnet> Muslims think the middle ages is still recent though
[21:56] <kane2013> Akademiker and you might not take into account how getting your leaders dictated by foreign countries and then bombed feels

[21:59] <akademiker> muslim world is super backwards. name me one islamic nobel prize winner
[21:59] <ionone> i live in east germany and i dont know the pain Kreygasm
[21:59] <zervaldo> Ionone really? is it all cool over there?
[22:00] <faddaaa> if politicians won't adress valid concerns of average citicen based on factual recent occurences (public bath groping, cologne, night clubs, insults and rapes) then people feel betrayed and like second class citizen.
[22:00] <akademiker> and vote memes like AfD
[22:00] <faddaaa> AfD FeelsGoodMan
[22:00] <zervaldo> yeah. reality isn't being described by the politicians, which is why the anti-immigrationparties are growing. so stupid
[22:01] <akademiker> AfD is as stupid as trump, but all other parties are super cucked
[22:01] <ionone> ye
[22:01] <kane2013> anti immigration parties are just like isis, taking advantage of pissed off people
[22:01] <lexneminis> hes not gonna host back Destiny FeelsBadMan
[22:01] <akademiker> either vote for hitler who lost half his brain or vote white genocide
[22:02] <zervaldo> i think we're fucked either way. no way out of this by now
[22:02] <akademiker> @kane2013 anti immigration parties dont invade foreign countries or burn people alive FailFish
[22:02] <ionone> we have refugees in a sports hall in the other town, also am old hospital is getting fully renovated to fit like 1k refugees
[22:03] <kane2013> Akademiker did "isis" do that 40 years ago?
[22:03] <zervaldo> you mean economic migrants :^)
[22:03] <faddaaa> @akademiker, I mean, my biggest concern right now is economic. My family residence is right next to a futurre refugee center and is gonna be worthless in a couple month and the minimum wage is in dager if we try to create work for uneducated migrants
[22:04] <zervaldo> indeed. the unemploymentrates for immigrants is abyssmal
[22:04] <akademiker> dont be concerned about uneducated migrants working, they will NEVER get a job
[22:04] <zervaldo> after 7 years, 50% still hasn't got a job
[22:04] <faddaaa> Major german party CDU proposed to abolish german minimum wage for refugees and only backpedaled after public outcry, you start to guess the intentions of merkel
[22:04] <akademiker> only 1 in 100 is fitted for "ausbildung"
[22:05] <akademiker> almost all refugees will stay on social welfare forever
[22:05] <criminal_cutie> Dude wtf unban me
[22:05] <criminal_cutie> Laready
[22:05] <criminal_cutie> Ugh

[22:05] <kane2013> 10/10
[22:06] <faddaaa> @akademiker, yeah let's see how we integrate "kid" refugees that are 16 (25 in reality): 5 years to learn german, 5 years for school, 5 years for "ausbildung" then they start paying income tax LUL
[22:06] <akademiker> germany just doesn't have those low qualification jobs anymore
[22:06] <kane2013> 25 year old needing 15 years to start a basic job FailFish

[22:06] <luxredux> @Faddaaa, Did you see all those pictures of "teenage" Swedish economic exploiters who look like +30 year old men? LUL
[22:07] <faddaaa> @Kane2013, dude we have whole turkish/libanees communitys in berlin where turks can't even speak a few german words after living here for 30 years..

[22:08] <ionone> stop being a nazi, fucking ignorent german Kappa
[22:08] <faddaaa> @Kane2013, agree

[22:08] <multix_gg> They just dont look like 30+ men, they are 30+ men
[22:09] <akademiker> refugees flee extremistic muslims and get greeted in the shelters with shariah law
[22:09] <zervaldo> yeah. its disgusting
[22:10] <multix_gg> We have ruined countries for the real refugees
[22:10] <multix_gg> For letting this "free immigration" happen

[22:32] <kane2013> guess most are
[22:32] <ionone> there was never evidence of anything
[22:32] <faddaaa> what happened? recently?
[22:32] <ionone> yes
[22:32] <faddaaa> weren't the swedish police chasing the ghost "nazi schlägertrupps" ?
[22:33] <zervaldo> lol, that thing.
[22:33] <multix_gg> Pretty sure they are gearing up for the upcoming summer of love

[22:34] <zervaldo> i'm getting a license for handguns lol. long process
[22:34] <ionone> ok
[22:34] <multix_gg> And most disgusting thing is that the same people who "invited them here" are okay for them doing criminal stuff and getting away with it because they are "different"
[22:34] <faddaaa> @Zerevorr, nice
[22:35] <multix_gg> Criminals should be treated as such, regardless of their race and religion
[22:35] <zervaldo> Multix_gg but they aren't privileged, white people are Kappa
[22:35] <faddaaa> @MultiX_GG, yeah tons of apologists here that would excuse it even if they get robbed or worse themselve
[22:35] <ionone> yup lots of storys going around here MulitX
[22:35] <kane2013> Multix_gg you know those who "invited them" are rich people in the southern countries?
[22:35] <kane2013> spreading lies earnign $$$$
[22:36] <faddaaa> @MultiX_GG, there was a leak that officials told Kiel police to not go after small crimes of refugees
[22:36] <faddaaa> double standard..
[22:36] <ionone> but they cant be that stupid ... thats how you build up right wing movements
[22:36] <destiny_bot> Destiny updates YouTube regularly now! "AtheneWins defends his charity operation" posted 5h 53m ago youtu.be/RQLreyPrYbM
[22:36] <multix_gg> Well, isnt selling drugs in germany by refugees pretty common sight nowdays, and police wont do anything about it
[22:36] <faddaaa> @ionONE, well they tried to not report on new years on state owned media ZDF FailFish
[22:38] <kane2013> no, drugs are sold by criminals
[22:38] <faddaaa> @MultiX_GG, don't know about that, but berlin parks/certain streets are littered with drug dealers
[22:38] <ionone> i know ...
[22:38] <ionone> but that happened on purpose right, german media cant be that stupid/controlled
[22:40] <faddaaa> @ionONE wait i will search a source in a second but recently there was one state media employee who literally said in a talk show that they have to pull the line on certain topics
[22:40] <zervaldo> all media is superbiased
[22:40] <ionone> i know
[22:40] <zervaldo> i'm not even sure where to go for neutral reporting in sweden

[00:01] <papa_emeritusiii> Trump isn't anti-establishment, he's authoritarian. Bernie voters will NOT jump ship to trump's xenophobic rich man masquerading as a republican party.

[00:01] <desdinova_terran> how bout those
[00:01] <arclitetanksc> he acts like bernie just started yesterday

[00:01] <ipickflowers> would you guys elect me? 4Head

[00:01] <bosspanda> @ipickflowers, Of course SeemsGood
[00:01] <protein_egg> He could fund it himself either way.
[00:01] <thegraeme> @desdinova_terran, the point about Trump being self funded is about him not being bought by large companies. He still takes in individual donations from voters because they have no bearing on what he says
[00:01] <lamynator> Steven makes a really good point when he's talkinga bout how similar Trump and Sanders voters are to eachother
[00:02] <ipickflowers> i want more memes SwiftRage /
[00:02] <lamynator> maybe they're similar for different reasons, but it can't be overlooked

[00:12] <arclitetanksc> she cant
[00:12] <liquidfire92> If she wants to gain his voters vs Trump

[00:12] <bosspanda> She won't though

[00:13] <speeedemo> i'd still jump ship tbh
[00:13] <alexandtheo> That situation is literally a SNL sketch
[00:13] <arclitetanksc> She will take warren to get bernie voters.

[00:30] <brock4ever> like thanking the banks for running the country
[00:30] <kreegath> What about the issue of the president's health? I mean, with McCain people were talking about what would happen if he died in office because of his advance age. If it's Sanders vs. Trump, we're voting between a 500 year old mummy versus a 300 year old vampire
[00:30] <infamousxreflex> PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES DONALD J TRUMP
[00:30] <mooskie88> look its the Bob Ross of autism!
[00:30] <zxininja> If Trump is elected, is it even possible for him to pass a single thing that he has planned on/said he would pass? It seems like everything Trump stands for is nigh impossible to pass.

[00:31] <thegraeme> @zXiNinja, apart from the shit about waterboarding and shit, most of it will probably get done. It's not that bad, calm it
[00:31] <byzantinenova> LOOOL WHAT A FLOG
[00:31] <ironchieftain> have you been paying attention? Trump has been winning states...
[00:31] <yomain> the worst is how Hillary is just Copy-Pasting Bernies ideals now that he got popular
[00:31] <brock4ever> @Zxininja If Trump wins, a wall is a near certainty. Getting mexico to pay is probably not likely. Huge increases in deportations and an immediate ban on muslims entering the country is possible from day 1
[00:31] <dicedlemming> bosspanda, how is that not bernie's fault? isnt him not creating any change just as poor a track record? like getting nothing done at all?
[00:31] <leviathan760> kramkalasqt, he's the front runner for the GOP atm
[00:31] <mom0momo> Dicedlemming but Trump got all that expensive medicare to keep im Orange
[00:31] <gawntlet> unless trump picks Palin as vp 4Head
[00:32] <testrun2632> @Destiny I LOVE YOU BBY GIRL <3 <3
[00:32] <bosspanda> @DICEDLEMMING, You realize it's up to congress to come to a consensus right? If bernie was president he would have mroe say over what bills pass
[00:32] <mom0momo> What does that mean?
[00:32] <mom0momo> Forced brokered convention?
[00:32] <ipickflowers> hey chat type 9 just cuz im retarded and i want you to
[00:32] <ipickflowers> 9
[00:32] <dicedlemming> bosspanda, he hasnt even passed state bills tho that he has authored
[00:32] <xuptupahc44> destiny do you even know what you're talking about?
[00:32] <derpetronicsfacility> @kramkalasqt america's the real joke FeelsBadMan
[00:32] <brock4ever> brokered convention is when no one candidate passes the threshold to get the nomination
[00:32] <dicedlemming> bosspanda, isnt it kind of shitty he cant compromise at all? or rally enough support EVER?
[00:32] <bosspanda> @DICEDLEMMING, Because Congress is retarded?
[00:32] <infamousxreflex> the turnout is too high and is looking like a Trump win for them to deny him
[00:33] <bosspanda> He is too smart for america
[00:33] <dicedlemming> bosspanda, how is he going to be a productive president?
[00:33] <gawntlet> Ipickflowers N VoHiYo I VoHiYo N VoHiYo E
[00:33] <brock4ever> so it becomes a mass negotiation to annoint one of the candidates, or even an outsider, like Romney
[00:33] <ipickflowers> FeelsBadMan
[00:33] <thenetwolf> This is politics, so I disagree that either party has any respect for themselves lol
[00:33] <bosspanda> You kind of have to trust in him dude
[00:33] <xuptupahc44> why doesnt destiny run for president
[00:33] <bosspanda> he is a really smart guy
[00:33] <ironchieftain> He's right. The super delegates don't vote against the people.
[00:33] <itsevan7> !momolewds
[00:33] <otrum> @Destiny insightful, thanks for the response.
[00:33] <dicedlemming> bosspanda, congress is going to be even MORE republican and if he has no experience getting anything passed why would u just 'trust him'
[00:33] <bosspanda> Because he has a plan unlike everyone else
[00:33] <bosspanda> why wouldn't i trust him?
[00:33] <brock4ever> @Dicedlemming If Bernie wins, Congress will almost certainly be more democrat, not republican

[00:34] <naterollsin09> Destiny in your opinion what is the percent chance that Hillary is an alien?
[00:34] <idra5ever> Destiny, if you think Hillary has no chance of winning the general election, you can make a 200% profit in prediction markets. www.predictwise.com
[00:34] <kramkalasqt> who are you voting for @Destiny

[01:11] <kane2013> Mom0momo because if they are played often, they are probably above average ?

[01:47] <destiny_bot> Remember to use Destiny's Amazon referral link! destiny.gg/amazon
[01:47] <potioncellar> @Destiny, I can understand the argument. However, I think that you need to find the line of "when is this too much". Eventually you'll drive people away with the amount of obnoxious popups.
[01:47] <darkzant27> Kreygasm holy fuck i need moar
[01:47] <rhanza> i jerked it

[01:47] <roivas1> destiny already milks his viewers more then any other streamer, nobody is leaving because he goes to g2a

[01:48] <carelesswhimper> what the fuck
[01:48] <papermashy> I just wish the whole thing wasn't associated with G2A, it makes the whole thing look shady
[01:48] <carelesswhimper> i havent streamed for years

[01:49] <bliggles> whats the appeal of this fucking game
[01:49] <tyree372> cranberry farmer now you should make some juice Kappa
[01:49] <derpetronicsfacility> @papermashy it sounds like the only person who really knows how much of the donation is split between streamer and charity is athene's company, so he could take a decent cut with no one knowing (initially)
[01:49] <dendem4n> i would love to see him go sellout and drown in dank memes
[01:49] <natescott430> MaliciousTechnology, that's why you buy their game insurance ResidentSleeper it's really shitty but that's how they do things

[01:50] <kantyash> some old lady goes on the website to support charity "oh, who's this handsome fella?" cue Destiny losing his shit on someone and telling them to kill themselves
[01:50] <counker> you can potentially buy one from the travelling merchant who shows up fridays/sundays
[01:50] <malicioustechnology> interesting, id never risk my 12 year old steam account to get a game a few bucks cheaper.
[01:50] <moustachely> @Destiny, rabbit's foot drops from the dragon fly things in the desert dungeon

[02:11] <morguito> I think he means racism is based more on hate, while xenophonia is more about fear. but yeah, it kinda is the same thing
[02:11] <taytlwolk> if you want to become Mexico 2.0? send the Mexicans back and feel how it is to do a shit job for no money. people don't realise the jobs Mexicans take you don't want.

[02:12] <fusrodayum> i mean id rather work on a farm in texas then deal with the cartels down there but thats just me
[02:12] <timislaw> @Tempestofchaos it means i could have mustered up a dollar to get a bite but i didnt want to
[02:12] <tempestofchaos> Malnutritioned=starving by definition
[02:12] <vexternal> I want to go to america, be civilized and vote for trump and then leave

[02:13] <tempestofchaos> @Timislaw for one meal? Good job, you have maybe 800-1000 of the daily 2200 calorie average requirement. Good logic.
[02:13] <chineseninjawarriorx> theres no replay value in this game

[02:14] <tempestofchaos> Does that matter? @Timislaw . You mocked people in America being hungry. You bringing up others who are worse off does not change the fact.

[02:15] <watermelonsquach> @Taytlwolk Well I guess there would be an effect if you just took 13 mil mexicans out of the country instantly, but you can't even say that because that is unrealistic. You can't just, through a day and night, remove 13 mil mexicans out of the US

[02:21] <taytlwolk> @watermelonsquach that's not salary that's per install. It would basically make our property values become Un-attainable and grind commercial construction to a stand still. we don't have skilled laborers anymore. it's impossible to find my head guy makes more than most the people at a tech company.
[02:21] <fusrodayum> the game is just a front for the most in depth political debate

[02:23] <watermelonsquach> @Taytlwolk I guess that makes sense. Not to mention the cost of kicking out all of the illegal immigrants. Its not going to be free. There's too much to debate here. You sound more knowledgeable than me in the field anyway. Looking at it in perspective, my first comment seems kind of arbitrary

[02:23] <spicykoreanboy> As a gamer, I support gay marriage. Makes it easier to find a girlfriend in the future.
[02:24] <supergameaim> birth rates were low in Germany during the depression
[02:24] <timmor> isn't a good part of places that are under the 2 per family
[02:24] <supergameaim> enough for National Socialists to legislate to encourage it

[02:35] <helloteam> gay marriage + adoption, yes
[02:35] <uncookedramen> She is a strong independent white woman, she does not need a man to help her.
[02:35] <timmor> neat
[02:35] <gnavon> DerpetronicsFacility, have you installed the latest BIOS drivers for your MOBO??
[02:35] <revalence123> So progressive Kreygasm
[02:35] <surgewi> KappaPride
[02:35] <midnight_ahri> destiny stop snorting
[02:35] <claw_gnusern> well now i HAVE to play it
[02:35] <cute_sc2> Hhhehehe Erisann you can't make us be nice in here Hhhehehe
[02:35] <revalence123> The real question is
[02:35] <bobthedoc> there is lesbian marriage too :)
[02:35] <liusslo> btw, are you able to plant trees in Town ?
[02:35] <viiperx> Miata is always the answer
[02:35] <revalence123> can you put all the non Americans behind a wall Kappa
[02:36] <claw_gnusern> lesbians are gay dawg KappaPride
[02:36] <mvpavenger> KappaPride marriage?
[02:36] <gnavon> DerpetronicsFacility, you could also try making sure your antivirus accepts the BIOS version you are trying to install which then should in turn make your alphanumeric keys work
[02:36] <cute_sc2> KappaPride !
[02:36] <surgewi> lesbians are gays you ***
[02:36] <gnavon> provided your cpu is cool enough
[02:36] <gnavon> :D
[02:36] <zohg> the miata is a go-cart
[02:36] <mvpavenger> KappaPride
[02:36] <derpetronicsfacility> @gnavon from what I recall they stopped producing BIOS updates a while ago, and I should be up to date
[02:36] <posetry> Destiny turned Amish? PogChamp
[02:36] <bobthedoc> that rock is part of the scenery u cant dig it
[02:36] <bobthedoc> done tried that
[02:36] <uncookedramen> I though erisann had her own stream?
[02:36] <cute_sc2> SpookerZ
[02:36] <revalence123> 100 grand WutFace
[02:36] <cute_sc2> I did too but for some reason I don't think she streams
[02:36] <revalence123> Thats fucking retarded BabyRage
[02:37] <gnavon> DerpetronicsFacility, sometimes the community makes their own bios drivers try going on a torrent sharing site to download the .exe drivers and proceed to install to your latest version
[02:37] <cute_sc2> anymore at least o.O
[02:37] <gnavon> or just contact ubisoft ot get a refund
[02:37] <destiny_bot> Destiny updates YouTube regularly now! "AtheneWins defends his charity operation" posted 9h 54m ago youtu.be/RQLreyPrYbM

[02:38] <gnavon> DerpetronicsFacility, perhaps you have to overclock your CPU and MOBO.... take a watch or a clock and place it above your computer's case to over clock it
[02:38] <linoleumknife> i want someone to pay for my wisdom teeth removal
[02:39] <flowtoss> hes been all on this game, is it dank or what?
[02:39] <mr_matoks> @Destiny, it's Nvidia and AMD

[01:37] <liquidfire92> Mr. Moon
[01:37] <natescott430> Brock4ever, you should find other news sources LUL
[01:38] <almagestum> Didn't Bill O'Reilly lose custody of his children for assaulting his wife?
[01:38] <y0nf> thanks

[01:40] <drgnak> I only form opinions after Destiny has given his. It makes things easy EleGiggle
[01:40] <almagestum> Assaulting your wife in front of one of your children is pretty pathetic though. It shows he really has no self control, I thought that was just his TV persona.
[01:40] <natescott430> Drgnak, EleGiggle NoTears
[01:41] <natescott430> Almagestum, b-b-but muh no spin zone Kappa

[01:42] <traiborn> the autism zone? Kappa
[01:42] <almagestum> Is that something he does?
[01:42] <natescott430> Almagestum, it's an O'Reilly thing

[01:42] <natescott430> Almagestum, he'll bring on guests
[01:43] <almagestum> Oh why on earth do you watch that?
[01:43] <natescott430> and the whole point is to "not put a spin on things" and talk factually
[01:43] <natescott430> but all he does is shit on people

[03:27] <r00gle> destiny yeah the middle man banned for RMT was named BuBuKiGeR
[03:27] <almagestum> Trump wants the power Hitler had.
[03:28] <gawntlet> I just want to get to Trump and Hilary debates and let the memes ensue
[03:28] <thee_hammertyme> Trump has legit points, like most Mexicans being rapists. That's a fact, for the most part.
[03:28] <almagestum> I think he already believes his own delusions of grandeur.
[03:28] <thee_hammertyme> It's been pretty proven by now.
[03:28] <gawntlet> 4Head
[03:28] <ironchieftain> FailFish
[03:28] <mooseferret> Cux
[03:29] <gawntlet> :/
[03:29] <mefjupl> tuck frump? PogChamp
[03:29] <almagestum> Can't tell if @Thee_hammertyme is troll or retarded... it's always such a fine line.
[03:29] <kappafather> cux?
[03:29] <ironchieftain> ^
[03:30] <wreckoon> trump is such an obvious con artist .. i can't believe how many followers he has
[03:30] <thee_hammertyme> When a man's right, he's right.
[03:31] <thee_hammertyme> Once he's President Trump, and you're giving an oath of allegiance to him, you'll understand.
[03:31] <almagestum> O
[03:31] <almagestum> I'm not American
[03:31] <bananathugg> Ive yet to see Trump say a directly racist thing
[03:31] <thee_hammertyme> Once Trump gets the presidency, you will be...
[03:31] <bananathugg> Trumps said racially ignorant things, but nothing directly negatively racist
[03:32] <r00gle> that is concidered inciting here in europe and people would get rekt for that shit
[03:32] <shoppingkart12> is this game worth it if you have no friends to play with?
[03:32] <mom0momo> hey guys
[03:32] <mom0momo> dibt forget to set your clocks 1hr forward
[03:33] <gawntlet> Shoppingkart12 I've the same question lol :( I dont know any Video Gamers irl
[03:33] <mom0momo> VoHiYo
[03:33] <sogeking411> hejj hjjj
[03:33] <almagestum> but I want to see Trump as president because America needs a taste of reality I don't mind living in a forest for a while... American Hitler at least after Hitler Germany had a lot of reform.
[03:33] <gnavon> !time
[03:33] <destiny_bot> 01:33 Central Steven Time
[03:33] <r00gle> the moment you target a country it stops beeing the "i dislike religion X" freespeech and becomes full born racism
[03:33] <sakkyoku> Roogle, Country != Race
[03:34] <wreckoon> that's the white guilt screaming out of you, detiny
[03:34] <sogeking411> VoHiYoVoHiYo VoHiYo VoHiYo
[03:34] <bananathugg> Alot of people actually consider middle easterners white
[03:34] <bananathugg> I mean, look at Jesus LUL
[03:34] <thee_hammertyme> @Almagestum You won't live in a forest, that's for hippies, which Trump hates. You will live in the cities and rural backwoods, be a productive citizen, and like it. Or else...
[03:34] <bananathugg> also, Jews are considered white
[03:34] <gawntlet> cmonBruh
[03:34] <almagestum> @Destiny Race, as a social construct, is a group of people who share similar and distinct physical characteristics. First used to refer to speakers of a common language and then to denote national affiliations, by the 17th century race began to refer to physical (i.e. phenotypical) traits. The term was often used in a general biological taxonomic sense, starting from the 19th century, to denote genetically differentiated human populations defined by phenotype
[03:34] <gnavon> @shoppingkart12 I'll be ur friend
[03:35] <thee_hammertyme> Look at @Almagestum copying and pasting. Must have been a Lincoln Chafee fan.
[03:35] <almagestum> So you can correctly say race in that context
[03:36] <bananathugg> Those Mexico statements arent racist. Its true. And nothing to do with mexicans, its to do with poor people willing to break the law and come here legally, thus their crime rates are higher
[03:36] <bananathugg> illegally*
[03:36] <destiny_bot> Remember to use Destiny's Amazon referral link! destiny.gg/amazon
[03:36] <thee_hammertyme> Plus, most Mexicans are racist.
[03:36] <thee_hammertyme> And they are rapists. It's a dual threat.

[03:37] <thee_hammertyme> Some Mexicans, I can only assume, are good people.
[03:37] <mom0momo> Hey guys
[03:37] <mom0momo> DON'T FORGET TO SET YOUR CLOCKS 1 HR AHEAD TONIGHT ANELE
[03:37] <bananathugg> momo, that shits all automatic now
[03:37] <almagestum> I wonder if American education wasn't so poor if the country would still be in this state socially.
[03:37] <gnavon> Clocks in current year?
[03:37] <bananathugg> I think Trump will get assassinated
[03:37] <majora1323> holy autism these people in chat actually support trump.
[03:38] <hendrix_3> did it already change?
[03:38] <bananathugg> Trump will be assassinated before he makes it to the white house
[03:38] <strafeyeh> who doesnt support trump?
[03:38] <judjuds> i mean did the guy even have any weapons on him
[03:38] <thee_hammertyme> It's one of the best @Almagestum. Look at Donald Trump, he knows the best words, all the words, in fact.
[03:38] <almagestum> Don't think they actually do @Majora1323 just people trolling
[03:39] <hendrix_3> did the time already change or is it sunday into monday it changes?
[03:39] <thee_hammertyme> @Almagestum You #FeelingTheChafe still?
[03:39] <nyafuu> time changed here
[03:39] <strafeyeh> trump or bernie and its going to be trump
[03:39] <hendrix_3> okay
[03:39] <wreckoon> maybe all the trump followers are actually trolling
[03:39] <wreckoon> funny joke khehee
[03:39] <almagestum> Trump is king of the trolls
[03:39] <3yetalian> Who are you supporting this election?
[03:39] <bananathugg> Bernie has said racist things, but Destiny doesnt care, because it was about white people FeelsBadMan
[03:40] <brock4ever> I'm writing in destiny
[03:40] <thee_hammertyme> The only thing better than Trump running for President, is Ann Coulter announcing and running. No one would stand a chance against her.
[03:40] <mom0momo> Guys
[03:40] <lordlynkz> shoots him in the head... bullet bounces off... ohhh division
[03:40] <mom0momo> How does this make you feel? http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/syrian-refugees-in-canada-got-housed-in-same-hotel-as-vancoufur-furry-convention-and-the-children-a6921341.html
[03:40] <merzbau> mexican is nationality
[03:40] <hkglfmdn> @bananathugg Well you can't be racist towards whites
[03:40] <bill_nye_the_spy> hispanics
[03:40] <nyafuu> jesus christ momo
[03:40] <bananathugg> @Hkglfmdn, LUL
[03:40] <nyafuu> that video is horrifying
[03:41] <lordlynkz> Mexican is an ethnicity of Hispanic
[03:41] <hellointernets> Lation = Protoss, Mexicans = Dark Templar
[03:41] <merzbau> Hispanic is the ethnicity
[03:41] <strafeyeh> what about the latinas
[03:41] <xander004> white mexicans LUL
[03:41] <almagestum> for foreign policy and domestic policy, it seems a lot of Americans don't care if their government screws over the world as only as Americans get fair treatment.
[03:41] <hellointernets> Cubans = Tal' Darim
[03:41] <brock4ever> Brazil = Abathur
[03:41] <ovpknives> race barriers blur across cultures arguing about race is like arguing about which language to use for a word
[03:41] <diarrhea_holocaust> theres actually quite a few white mexicans
[03:41] <bananathugg> But you cant be racist towards Hispanics if you're talking directly about Mexicans
[03:41] <lordlynkz> It's both.
[03:41] <bananathugg> Trump isnt talking about Hispanics from other countries
[03:41] <brock4ever> Romneys dad was Mexican
[03:41] <scereno> Mexican is an inferior ethnicity
[03:41] <thee_hammertyme> @Almagestum The rest of the world owes something to us, the Americans. So, yeah. They had it coming, whoever it is.
[03:41] <almagestum> race isn't strictly defined like that.
[03:42] <mom0momo> OuO
[03:42] <bananathugg> If Trump wanted a wall between us and Canada, would you call him racist?
[03:42] <kamunster> OuO
[03:42] <wreckoon> wait, are mexicans actual people
[03:42] <mom0momo> Kamunster did you hear?
[03:42] <nyafuu> no
[03:42] <thee_hammertyme> @Almagestum What would the rest of the world do without Capitalism? Huh?
[03:42] <nyafuu> they only exist for mexican food
[03:42] <kamunster> MoM0MoMo, of what?
[03:42] <mom0momo> read this Kamunster http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/syrian-refugees-in-canada-got-housed-in-same-hotel-as-vancoufur-furry-convention-and-the-children-a6921341.html OuO
[03:42] <nyafuu> :)
[03:42] <almagestum> lol
[03:42] <newvirtue> hawaiians count as brown ppl?
[03:42] <lordlynkz> Puerto Ricans do not like Mexicans historically
[03:42] <almagestum> @Thee_hammertyme trolling too hard
[03:42] <gnavon> Momo
[03:43] <mom0momo> Gnavon hey
[03:43] <gnavon> Lewds tonight?
[03:43] <bananathugg> Trump may actually be referring to Hispanics and be meaning it in a racist way, but you would have to assume what hes thinking when he makes those statements
[03:43] <kamunster> MoM0MoMo, what a time to be alive AngelThump
[03:43] <mom0momo> i got plenty of lewds
[03:43] <gnavon> !momolewds
[03:43] <ogphoto> @Destiny, discrimination refers to a group of people. So when Trump generalizes towards a group of people then that is discriminatory by definition. Calling it racist or anything else is a semantic.
[03:43] <morrows> MoM0MoMo, that article LUL
[03:43] <mom0momo> But Ima horde them all just like Wall Street
[03:43] <mom0momo> Kappa
[03:43] <judjuds> who gives a shit about caitlyn jenner rofl
[03:43] <mom0momo> Where 99% of all lewds go to the top 1%
[03:43] <garrex28> if it isnt racism, is it just not xenophobia?

[03:44] <mom0momo> One question
[03:44] <brock4ever> Destiny going down more than pacjax at a gay trucker convention
[03:44] <strafeyeh> building a wall is not racist
[03:44] <mom0momo> How can Caitlin Jenner be "Woman of the year" If she was a woman less than a year at the time?
[03:44] <bananathugg> Its not mental gymnastics. Trump may be referring to all hispanics when referencing Mexicans, which would be racist. Or he may literally just mean people from the country of Mexico, which is not a race.
[03:44] <diarrhea_holocaust> lmao ^
[03:44] <strafeyeh> its just a wall
[03:44] <mom0momo> DansGame
[03:44] <nyafuu> @MoM0MoMo, so brave
[03:44] <bdair2002> wait, is @Destiny supporting TrumpF?
[03:45] <gnavon> Momo asking the real questions
[03:45] <brock4ever> He dislikes trump
[03:45] <mom0momo> Momo asking the hard hitting questions
[03:45] <diarrhea_holocaust> no hes not, Destiny is becoming more of a liberal sjw by the day
[03:45] <nyafuu> did bruce jenner ever get arrested for running over that person
[03:45] <mom0momo> ÒuÓ
[03:45] <strafeyeh> who does destiny support atm
[03:45] <diarrhea_holocaust> bernie, probably
[03:46] <thee_hammertyme> Lets be real, most of us in this chat wouldn't be supporting Trump if it wasn't for the honorable Sarah Palin throwing her endorsement behind him.
[03:46] <ajwzuk> bernie apparently :^)
[03:46] <brock4ever> Bernie more than anyone
[03:46] <thee_hammertyme> That's when I was like, "wow, this is going places now."
[03:46] <newvirtue> is american and british 2 different races?
[03:46] <destiny_bot> Destiny updates YouTube regularly now! "Politics, electoral college (USA) and gerrymandering" posted 11h 46m ago youtu.be/b7g2Z0ATeZQ
[03:46] <nintendojitsu> Bernie won't have enough delegates to win the Dem nomination
[03:46] <mom0momo> type !momolewds to receive new lewd pics
[03:46] <nyafuu> british would fall under the arab race
[03:46] <strafeyeh> no america and Britain is the same
[03:46] <bananathugg> Bernie bros unite haHAA
[03:46] <bushmanx> @nintendojitsu how will he not
[03:46] <gnavon> !momolewds
[03:46] <nyafuu> !momolewds
[03:47] <newvirtue> so race is determined by what? language?
[03:47] <hokage641> whoa that guy has crazy good stats or something.
[03:47] <gawntlet> Almagestum i know what you mean. Its holds a deeper and broader meaning, as you described, rather than simple black, white, blue etc
[03:47] <mom0momo> What if you had to pay a fee to receive !momolewds?
[03:47] <bdair2002> I am arab myself, I think Arab nation contains many races
[03:47] <badogski2911> Any canadians here
[03:47] <mefjupl> lol
[03:47] <brock4ever> Saw Game Change yesterday about Palin in 2012... Apparently she didn't know what the queens role in Britain was LUL
[03:47] <blackjackaltv> I'm Canadian.
[03:47] <nintendojitsu> Hillary has a lead of 200+ over him
[03:47] <wreckoon> i don't trust a clinton, i've seen house of cards
[03:47] <brock4ever> I mean 2008
[03:47] <bananathugg> @Destiny, You realize to call Trump a racist for referring to Mexicans, you would have to prove that hes really referring to Hispanics right?
[03:47] <goodluckgus> Tell me how you can fund those idealistic policies?
[03:47] <badogski2911> Really cant relate tbh
[03:48] <gawntlet> Blackjackaltv whats up my YYC buddy

[03:48] <diarrhea_holocaust> Islamophobia, actually.
[03:48] <ajwzuk> phobia implies irrationality
[03:48] <scereno> Mexico does send racists and murderers over here
[03:48] <bushmanx> @nintendojitsu yea but almost all the states after the 15 support bernie
[03:48] <scereno> it's not a debate it's a fact
[03:48] <kreegath> No
[03:48] <gawntlet> i have yet to discover what my phobia is
[03:48] <blackjackaltv> Gawnlet trying to learn to live with a broken hand, still
[03:48] <thebunz> @Destiny, he was reffering to the people who smuggle people here from mexico when he called them rapists and shit
[03:48] <goatybay> 1.6 billion
[03:48] <thebunz> @Destiny, which has been proven
[03:48] <nervaxyz> @Destiny, Don't forget to get the drops
[03:49] <gawntlet> 4Head
[03:49] <jaziken> to be fair most people hate america
[03:49] <kreegath> Mexico as a country is not organizing transfers of convicted murderers to the US
[03:49] <goatybay> 800m+ muslims hate America
[03:49] <jaziken> EleGiggle
[03:49] <mom0momo> What do you call someone who afraid of momo?
[03:49] <r00gle> but everybody hates america so that is not that wierd
[03:49] <newvirtue> who the fk cares if hes racist. shouldnt we be more worried that hes probably going to put his name on the front of the white house?
[03:49] <scereno> momolewds?
[03:49] <mom0momo> Momophobia
[03:49] <gnavon> Nono?
[03:49] <gnavon> Lol

[03:49] <mom0momo> Alright
[03:49] <nothingkwt> >saudy

[03:50] <mefjupl> how smart is average american ?
[03:50] <r00gle> and its not the american people that are hated its just the politics that get the fuck america hate
[03:50] <nyafuu> sweden
[03:50] <mom0momo> Ill start, the UK
[03:50] <mom0momo> Kappa
[03:50] <garrex28> liechtenstein
[03:50] <nyafuu> I'll start, japan
[03:50] <gawntlet> Blackjackaltv oh no what happened? how did you break it
[03:50] <newvirtue> is this being played on pc or console?
[03:50] <badogski2911> How can people see trump as a rational person. That guy probably is one of the more dense people ive seen my whole life.
[03:50] <bananathugg> Honestly, religious discrimination doesnt bother me nearly as much as racism since you choose to follow your religion
[03:50] <gnavon> I'll start, DPRK
[03:50] <nintendojitsu> Nyafuu plz
[03:50] <bananathugg> i know im on the wrong side there, but I just cant get myself to care as much
[03:50] <wreckoon> i pick the entirety of africa
[03:50] <eatoats> pf god damd c
[03:50] <auronj> @Newvirtue hes never streamed on console, so pc
[03:51] <blackjackaltv> Gawnlet I ran into Hardwood in the tall grass. I used mega punch and it used harden. I lost.
[03:51] <bushmanx> @nintendojitsu I don't think so, especially if bernie wins 2 - 3 states on the 15
[03:51] <mefjupl> thing is that he is talking to "ze common man" if he said islamic extremist, nobody would know what he is talking bout
[03:51] <gawntlet> Blackjackaltv cmonBruh :(
[03:51] <nintendojitsu> he needs all of them to do that
[03:52] <ptampham> #MakeDonaldDrumpfAgain
[03:52] <diarrhea_holocaust> Stevens nitpicking liberal attitude is what made Europe a shithole filled with degenerates. His heart is in the right place but those beliefs are really naive. Source: Swedish, seen it first hand
[03:52] <bushmanx> no he doesn't there are more then enough delegates for bernie to win
[03:52] <thee_hammertyme> @Badogski2911 How is he dense? Name one policy he has talked about and tell me how it'd be bad for America.
[03:52] <newvirtue> is this game worth purchasing and playing with only random ppl? idk anyone else irl with a decent pc
[03:52] <eatoats> let all just get along and be happy
[03:52] <bushmanx> counting bernie out would be a big mistake
[03:52] <goodluckgus> I feel like Trump is tapping into a silent majority of scared people who want to practice isolation to increase the economy in US which could work, but not with a racist like Trump.
[03:52] <nintendojitsu> what part of he is already down by 200+ don't you get
[03:53] <bananathugg> A religion is a set of ideas though. Not all sets of ideas are equal, and some ideas are really bad.
[03:53] <lxmur> KKona
[03:53] <mom0momo> 1 question
[03:53] <thebunz> A lot of the people who think trump is racist are just racist themselves
[03:53] <hendrix_3> lol never blind fire...continues to blind fire
[03:53] <nyafuu> everyone is racist :)
[03:53] <mom0momo> How come destiny would play this game but not Destiny?
[03:53] <bushmanx> Dude he is only down that much because of the southern states after the 15 the southern states are done and almost all the states support bernie
[03:53] <hipks> Hihi
[03:53] <mefjupl> sat obs micro Kreygasm
[03:53] <gawntlet> only reason i dont want Trump to win is because Jon Stewart isnt the host anymore :(
[03:54] <newvirtue> how does the party system in this game work?
[03:54] <wreckoon> the host of what
[03:54] <thee_hammertyme> @Bushmanx Funny thing is, ALL of the states do and will support Trump for President.
[03:54] <gawntlet> Daily Show
[03:54] <thee_hammertyme> Hell, If the Repubs don't play nice, you'll see the first Independent President. You'll see.
[03:54] <nyafuu> the democrat show
[03:54] <bushmanx> @thee_hammertyme hahaha that's a joke right?
[03:54] <newvirtue> you just drop in and out easily, or do u kind of plan to play with the same ppl for long periods of time?
[03:54] <ptampham> Trump will not be a good president
[03:54] <bert_bert_bert> destiny game is not on pc? or he doesnt own a console to play it momo
[03:54] <nervaxyz> @Destiny, forgot a blue drop on the upper floor
[03:55] <eatoats> i don't think any of them will b be good
[03:55] <gawntlet> I would vote for Jeffery Shih though VoHiYo
[03:55] <ptampham> His supporters mainly consist of old white people who haven't gotten over the Civil War
[03:55] <mefjupl> @Ptampham why Obama cant stay president NotLikeThis ...
[03:55] <thee_hammertyme> @Ptampham He'd be the best. Mexico is coming for our jobs, then your white daughter. He's the one that can stop them.
[03:56] <ironchieftain> and apparently teenage boys who watch Destiny's stream EleGiggle
[03:56] <goldengun85> LOL
[03:56] <nyafuu> my grandparents like trump because they think hillary is part of the new world order
[03:56] <nyafuu> :)
[03:56] <bananathugg> Question Destiny. If Trump said mean things towards Canadians, would you deem that racist? Do you not think your own racially focused mind could be equating "Mexicans" with "Brown people". Or do you assume thats what Trumps mind is doing?
[03:56] <bushmanx> @thee_hammertyme I can't tell if your trolling or not
[03:56] <scereno> @Ptampham, negros deserve nothing more than to be of service to the white man
[03:56] <destiny_bot> Destiny has a new Twitter! twitter.com/OmniDestiny
[03:56] <nintendojitsu> your grandparents are idiots
[03:56] <ptampham> @thee_hammertyme I'm not white tho, so I don't have a white daughter
[03:56] <mom0momo> how come that 65+ ppl would vote for Hillary or Trump but 18-30 would vote for Bernie?
[03:56] <thee_hammertyme> @Ptampham Yes you are, stop lying for the sake of argument.
[03:56] <thebunz> @bananathugg, the fact that he thinks some of th comments are racist means he probably would just retarded logic all around
[03:56] <mefjupl> lol
[03:57] <thee_hammertyme> @Ptampham What, are you one of them Mexicans?!
[03:57] <bananathugg> I really really want an answer to that question
[03:57] <bananathugg> Im interested
[03:57] <eatoats> its a bad question
[03:57] <ironchieftain> because 65 year old people get their news from corporate media
[03:57] <nyafuu> ask it in destiny.gg
[03:57] <bushmanx> @bananathugg do u actually support trump
[03:58] <nintendojitsu> as I said idiots
[03:58] <bananathugg> no, gg chat is gross
[03:58] <mefjupl> ptamptham is islamic ANELE
[03:58] <nyafuu> then get banned after
[03:58] <diarrhea_holocaust> Ironchieftain, and where do you get your news from?
[03:58] <vermicelli> bananathugg,
[03:58] <thebunz> what kind of autistic response is that
[03:58] <vermicelli> xD
[03:58] <ptampham> @thee_hammertyme And those Mexicans who are taking your jobs? They don't have the education to get any of the jobs that people actually want, so they are taking the jobs with crap pay. The jobs they are taking are the minimum wage jobs that no one with a college education would have. And no, I am not Mexican. I'm Asian, which you obviously can tell just by reading my name
[03:58] <judjuds> its a really stupid question
[03:58] <ironchieftain> specific sources on the internet not government owned
[03:58] <thebunz> thinks trump is racist but when someone asks hima qestion that he actually has to think about he responds with autism
[03:58] <tjchickenandstarscampbell> Destiny is a dead game.
[03:59] <diarrhea_holocaust> alright, which ones, give me an example.
[03:59] <gawntlet> Intense
[03:59] <bananathugg> I think that was Destiny's autistic way of saying that Trump is equating Mexicans with brown people
[03:59] <lordlynkz> this game us much better with friends
[03:59] <gawntlet> ya
[03:59] <thee_hammertyme> @Ptampham Should've known. I thought you fell asleep when creating your name, hit a bunch of keys on the keyboard or something. Anyway, I know several Mexicans who have taken over as electricians. Explain that one, commie.
[03:59] <lordlynkz> is*spawn camped
[03:59] <vermicelli> bananathugg, DuckerZ
[03:59] <ironchieftain> nah, I already know where that's going to lead
[04:00] <bananathugg> Verm unban me from Reckfuls chat
[04:00] <nintendojitsu> is the lag on his side or the game itself?
[04:00] <ptampham> @thee_hammertyme They're taking those jobs so they can support their families. And I would rather have a bunch of Mexicans in our country than racist pricks like you
[04:00] <eatoats> oh my god your dumb
[04:00] <vermicelli> bananathugg, why are you banned/
[04:00] <goldengun85> he's just a troll. Stop feeding him, @Ptampham
[04:00] <mefjupl> amen @Ptampham
[04:00] <mom0momo> Hey
[04:00] <thee_hammertyme> @Ptampham No, they're taking those jobs to probably support a drug habit. Most of them are hopped up on speed and meth anyway.
[04:00] <thebunz> @Ptampham, how fucking retarded are you what about the americans who lost their jobs to them because they can work for less
[04:00] <bananathugg> someone randomly perma banned me, doppelmannen, and logicisdope
[04:00] <mom0momo> WHO HERE IS ON SPRING BREAK?
[04:00] <mom0momo> OuO

[04:00] <bananathugg> we werent even talking, and the mod said nothing
[04:01] <gawntlet> momo im 28. University happened a while ago
[04:01] <xuptupahc44> SAME IM GONNA DO NOTHING ALL WEEK
[04:01] <ptampham> @thee_hammertyme And I'm not a communist, because communism doesn't fucking work. I was born and raised in the USA by parents who left Vietnam to escape the grasps of the illusion of communism
[04:01] <mefjupl> what is this game? he is crawling most of the time
[04:01] <bushmanx> @thee_hammertyme immigrants aren't taking anyone's jobs their doing the jobs no one wants the reason were losing jobs is because of businesses outsourcing to other countries
[04:01] <nintendojitsu> I don't remember this area of the game being so difficult
[04:02] <goldengun85> looks like they're doing the mission on hard
[04:02] <xuptupahc44> They died, why are they allowed to keep going?
[04:02] <thee_hammertyme> @Bushmanx You must be a Mexican, too, like @Ptampham. Go figure.
[04:02] <xuptupahc44> shouldnt it be failure state/
[04:02] <jaziken> 50 dkp minus for atlas
[04:02] <xuptupahc44> the fuck is this casual shit they died, this is cheap
[04:02] <bushmanx> @thee_hammertyme why are you closed minded
[04:02] <nintendojitsu> I think they came here too soon. I was level 27 and solo'd
[04:02] <iamgoaticus> Crushm what the fuck
[04:03] <goldengun85> just ignore hammer. He's a troll.
[04:03] <ptampham> @thee_hammertyme And you must be a racist prick who has ancient beliefs they probably got from their weekly Klan meetings
[04:03] <mefjupl> guys chill
[04:03] <thee_hammertyme> @Ptampham Bottom line is, once Trump builds that damn beautiful wall, and takes on the Mexicans, he'll take on the Middle Easterners, knock the shit out of them, and then you'll see.
[04:03] <madvillain27> kys trumple
[04:03] <nintendojitsu> why isn't hammer banned already?
[04:03] <shuntlike> Ptampham is mad he'll be deported
[04:03] <thee_hammertyme> @Shuntlike Exactly.
[04:04] <thee_hammertyme> Not my problem, should've come here legally.
[04:04] <bushmanx> @thee_hammertyme you are falling into the trap that big businesses and the gov. have made so that white people like you think that it's people that have less then you but work harder then you are the problem
[04:04] <ptampham> @thee_hammertyme Bottom line is, you're a close minded fuck who's only joy in life is to make bully people who aren't white
[04:04] <mefjupl> lol guys stop it, cut politics
[04:04] <heart_lines> guys stop eating the bait
[04:05] <jinjin5000> MingLee
[04:05] <thebunz> @Ptampham, oh boo fucking whooo grow the fuck up you stupid pussy your in a twicth chat room
[04:05] <bananathugg> #KASICH2016
[04:05] <ptampham> I'm sorry @mefjupl I'm too busy getting fucking angry
[04:05] <thebunz> did you want him to massage your balls
[04:05] <nintendojitsu> the irony of supporting a potential Presidential candidate who wasn't born here and wants to kick out all immigrants
[04:05] <gawntlet> What do you think Jeb is doing right now
[04:05] <bushmanx> @thee_hammertyme the war in the middle east is a useless wast of money there is no reason for us to be there
[04:05] <goldengun85> Kasich would be better than any of the other Repub candidates. That's not saying much though
[04:05] <renderuntome> @TheBunz, pls touch my ballz
[04:05] <moondoggie01> Gawntlet making some of his famous guac Kappa
[04:06] <gawntlet> :D
[04:06] <nintendojitsu> Jeb is plotting his revenge on Trump
[04:06] <ptampham> @goldengun85 Yeah at least Kasich looks huggable
[04:06] <bananathugg> I liked Jim Webb for the 2 days he was running
[04:06] <bushmanx> @goldengun85 true
[04:06] <bananathugg> RIP Jim Webb
[04:06] <eatoats> you must be really pathetic to get so angry over twitch chat idiots
[04:06] <destiny_bot> Robot Lady will read your message for $5 or more donations twitchalerts.com/donate/destiny
[04:06] <thee_hammertyme> @Bushmanx What, are you crazy? You wouldn't be playing video games if it wasn't for big business. How's that trap you fell into, huh? The war in the Middle East, Iraq in particular, was a waste of money. But, wiping out ISIS, then taking out the rapists in Mexico would be worth it.
[04:06] <mom0momo> >tfw you lose 1 hour of browsing dank memes due to daylight savings
[04:06] <mom0momo> nathanFeels
[04:07] <johnspecter> !momolewds
[04:07] <thee_hammertyme> @Bushmanx You're probably secretly Mexican, so you won't understand. Plus, you're probably establishment.
06[04:07] * nintendojitsu has ignored Thee_hammertyme
06[04:07] * johnspecter Nice meme
[04:08] <bushmanx> @thee_hammertyme your are actually an idiot big business are stealing from all of the American people not only money but jobs and the war in the middle east is the same thing as the Iraq war a huge wast of time and money
[04:08] <mom0momo> Rate my lewds out of 10
[04:08] <gnavon> 10
[04:08] <vacuiti> !momolewds
[04:08] <ptampham> @thee_hammertyme Go back to your Klan meeting. Aren't you a little busy dancing around a cross to troll people on a twitch stream
[04:08] <bananathugg> "Trump is racist towards a country and racist toward a religion" -Berniecucks 2016 LUL
[04:08] <vacuiti> wat is that
[04:08] <ironchieftain> jesus this stream attracts retards like a giant magnet
[04:08] <thee_hammertyme> @Ptampham No, we meet tomorrow.
[04:08] <bushmanx> @thee_hammertyme oh God yet he establishment has really brainwashed you huh
[04:08] <gawntlet> dont forget to change the time tonight
[04:08] <shuntlike> bernie bums are racist towards my taxes
[04:09] <nintendojitsu> turrets are needed for this one
[04:09] <vacuiti> wtf
[04:09] <memegotchi> is this a trump vs. bernie debate preview? BrokeBack
[04:09] <mom0momo> Gawntlet already did
[04:09] <mom0momo> :(
[04:09] <memegotchi> or should I say alternate history since Bernie is RIP nathanRuse
[04:09] <thee_hammertyme> Trump will lower all of our taxes and make the Mexicans pay for it instead. Only he'd be able to get that done.
[04:09] <johnspecter> Didn't Berine say that no white person will ever understand what its like to be poor?
[04:09] <ptampham> No just a racism debate @memegotchi between us and a Klan member named @thee_hammertyme
[04:10] <memegotchi> well i was half right then FeelsGoodMan
[04:10] <creepingwolf925> My dick is no bigger then an iPod Nano #DickConfession
[04:10] <eatoats> give it up
[04:10] <johnspecter> @CreepingWolf925, while hard?
[04:10] <mom0momo> Name a country that would support Donald Trump
[04:10] <johnspecter> USA
[04:10] <shuntlike> pakistan
[04:10] <creepingwolf925> Yes
[04:10] <ptampham> @thee_hammertyme Trump is going to start World War 3 before he builds that fucking wall
[04:10] <bushmanx> @thee_hammertyme now I know your trolling Trump's "plan" is going to put the country in about 15 trillion more in debt
[04:10] <nintendojitsu> other than backwards yokels
[04:10] <thee_hammertyme> @Mom0momo Mexico after he woops its ass and makes it pay our taxes, and for a wall.
[04:11] <thee_hammertyme> @Mom0momo Next?
[04:11] <johnspecter> @CreepingWolf925, damn man. start lifting then if you already aren't. being in shape is a huge bonus
[04:11] <thee_hammertyme> @Ptampham And he would make sure we win WWIII.
[04:11] <bananathugg> LUL NICE MENTAL GYMNASTICS
[04:11] <nintendojitsu> there are actually 5 snipers
[04:11] <thee_hammertyme> @Ptampham You'd be forced to enlist to earn your keep, but that's OK.
[04:11] <thaevilone1> Follow mee
[04:11] <gawntlet> I wish harry potter wizards were real so that after Trump builds the wall, he could have them put some super dank enchantments and spells on it
[04:11] <shuntlike> shoutouts to all my hillary voters in chat
[04:12] <ptampham> @thee_hammertyme Really? Us versus the rest of the world? Yeah, we're definitely gonna win that fight
[04:12] <nintendojitsu> ayy Shuntlike
[04:12] <skinner84> Serious question, how can anyone vote hillary knowing who she's funded by?
[04:12] <skinner84> Makes no sense to me
[04:12] <thee_hammertyme> @Ptampham Trump would probably turn us into a real economic powerhouse by then.
[04:12] <memegotchi> Trump in regards to avoiding STD's while fucking women at clubs:: "“It is my personal Vietnam. I feel like a great and very brave soldier.”"
[04:12] <thee_hammertyme> @Ptampham Then it'd be no sweat.
[04:12] <tigertower> hillary should be in jail for having top secret information on a private server that she had created while sec of state
[04:12] <thaevilone1> its freee
[04:12] <memegotchi> this is who evangelicals are voting for LUL
[04:12] <bananathugg> @Destiny, he literally said "white people dont know what its like to be poor" literally
[04:12] <thee_hammertyme> @Memegotchi Truer words never spoken.
[04:12] <zephyas> that's basically what media does with all politicians they want to blast.
[04:12] <skinner84> She's full of shit
[04:12] <ptampham> @thee_hammertyme An economic powerhouse supported by old white people from South Carolina
[04:13] <bananathugg> He literally said that NotLikeThis
[04:13] <bananathugg> go watch the clip again
[04:13] <bushmanx> @bananathugg your watching an edited clip
[04:13] <nintendojitsu> told ya
[04:13] <bananathugg> I watched the full clip
[04:13] <bananathugg> and I watched his explanation afterward
[04:13] <thee_hammertyme> @Ptampham If you believe the media establishment. Most of the states, including Mexicans and Hispanics, think that the illegals should be kicked out. That's a fact, Jack.
[04:13] <johnspecter> do you have a link? @bananathugg
[04:14] <gawntlet> "2 + 2 is fking 4 you aspie retard, not 5! kys! ahhh i cant take this"
[04:14] <vacuiti> so did he literally say it or did he say if figuratively
[04:14] <bushmanx> @thee_hammertyme dude how old are you
[04:14] <r00gle> destiny i think you would be great as a teacher you make the type of teacher that you can mention a topic to and you spend an entire lesson talking about it
[04:14] <mom0momo> Alright boys
[04:14] <johnspecter> Leaving us?
[04:14] <ironchieftain> he talks to poor white people all the time.. are you guys fucking stupid? do you not know how to interpret quotes?
[04:14] <mom0momo> If Donald Trump played LoL, which champion would he play?
[04:14] <vacuiti> darius
[04:14] <johnspecter> He wouldn't play that shitty game
[04:14] <gawntlet> Mom0momo great question!!
[04:14] <shuntlike> nazir
[04:14] <r00gle> MoM0MoMo, adolf ?
[04:14] <tigertower> no he fucking literally said it because he is trying to get black voters... y fucking hide it the only reason he is behind Clinton is because of the black vote
[04:14] <thee_hammertyme> @R00gle He gets his talking points from me.
[04:14] <bananathugg> Yes, obviously, but in trying to defend black people he said a stupid thing about white people. That he probably doesnt even believe, but he said it in clear context meaning those words.
[04:14] <johnspecter> What StarCraft race would Trump play?
[04:15] <vacuiti> and he'd talk shit when he gets 4 man ganked and say "needd 4 to kill me lol noobs"
[04:15] <mom0momo> Nazir?
[04:15] <fleshygordon> @R00gle "But mr.destiny, how does this work?" "ARE YOUI FUCKING RETARDED?!" -destiny
[04:15] <gawntlet> Mom0momo i'd say Yasuo
[04:15] <ptampham> @thee_hammertyme So? We used to be the United States of America. Last I checked, Mexico is a part of America. Calling ourselves the US of A when we're leaving out a third of the A is not fucking right, you Nazi
[04:15] <mom0momo> Gawntlet why noy Anivia
[04:15] <mom0momo> Azir makes sense
[04:15] <shuntlike> Mom0momo http://img1.leaguecraft.com/skins/asset/skin_1423141920_760px_54553_1.jpg
[04:15] <mom0momo> he'll make Shurima Great Again
[04:15] <melissus> didn't they actually ask "what is your greatest weakness" at a gop debate
[04:15] <r00gle> fleshygordon, no the trick is to say something that he likes talking about like politics
[04:15] <gawntlet> Mom0momo LOL of course
[04:15] <memegotchi> probably zilean. throws stunning bombs and very annoying to kill
[04:15] <ozcollo> I'm looking forward to watching it in full. Hearing his answer intially made me say "wtf", but I haven't read further into it.
[04:15] <bushmanx> @thee_hammertyme so your probably 60+ or you got brainwashed by your racist af grandparents

[04:16] <nintendojitsu> Destiny you need a turret on your team. it would help tremendously

[04:16] <r00gle> turrets are great at taking agro for a short while
[04:16] <shuntlike> bernie just lets a group of blacks throw him off the stage
[04:16] <memegotchi> at least he came out on the stage Kappa
[04:17] <moondoggie01> Shuntlike because he wants their votes
[04:17] <gawntlet> he was just being nice and let em have their memes out before security took them
[04:17] <bushmanx> @memegotchi savage af
[04:17] <ironchieftain> he let them speak.. they didn't throw him off the stage lol
[04:17] <mom0momo> Is Destiny play PvP or PvE?
[04:17] <nintendojitsu> once you take this, there will be a push from the opposite direction
[04:17] <gawntlet> although you gotta be careful. some brotha with a knife could climb on the stage too
[04:17] <ptampham> The amount of time @thee_hammertyme is taking to think of a comeback is how long he was in school before he quit
[04:18] <nintendojitsu> @Mom0momo both
[04:18] <moondoggie01> we dark souls now boys
[04:18] <gawntlet> which game had better concepts for bosses, Dark souls 1 or 2
[04:18] <shuntlike> white shotgun privilege
[04:18] <johnspecter> Diablo 2 HEH
[04:19] <moondoggie01> dark souls 1 is a better game in almost every possible aspect Gawntlet
[04:19] <vacuiti> dark souls 1 had some shit design
[04:19] <horolynnn> depends on what do you mean by concepts, but I'd say ds1 had better bosses overall
[04:19] <ptampham> Bloodborne is bae
[04:19] <eatoats> what do you mean.?
[04:19] <heliconpath> ds2 was pretty bad compared to ds1
[04:19] <gawntlet> I loved that butterfly boss that sang n shot spiky spells at you
[04:19] <moondoggie01> DS1 was a literal mastah peece
[04:19] <bananathugg> I liked Ds2 pvp
[04:19] <mom0momo> Grill?
[04:19] <frostythegermansnowman> Ds2 was an easier casual Ds
[04:19] <mom0momo> OuO
[04:20] <ptampham> DS2 was rated T for Teen
[04:20] <horolynnn> Frostythegermansnowman first of all, how is that bad, second of all, no it fuckign wasn't
[04:20] <vacuiti> I just wish people would stop meming about how it's "hard'
[04:20] <horolynnn> dark souls was never intended to be hard
[04:20] <horolynnn> the developer himself said it
[04:20] <s0fa_king> cmonBruh
[04:20] <nintendojitsu> Dark Souls was perfect imho
[04:21] <moondoggie01> Nintendojitsu indeed
[04:21] <heliconpath> Horolynnn you're gonna need a source for that bud
[04:21] <vacuiti> there's some parts that have really bad level design though
[04:21] <nintendojitsu> everything after it is trash
[04:21] <eatoats> the games tag line was "prepare to die".
[04:21] <s0fa_king> Dark souls 2 was a fail blood borne was somewhat of a redemption.
[04:21] <gawntlet> Destiny you'll be playing Dark Souls 3 yes? Kreygasm
[04:21] <horolynnn> prepare to die was dlc
[04:21] <heliconpath> haha yeah it absolutely was meant to be hard
[04:21] <nintendojitsu> the sequels and spinoffs i mena
[04:21] <horolynnn> and it was only because they were trying to capitalize on the memes
[04:21] <nintendojitsu> mean
[04:21] <shuntlike> Dark Souls: Black Lives Matter Edition
[04:21] <moondoggie01> Vacuiti the level design is near flawless uwotm8 unless you count the poorly optimized swamp place
[04:21] <frostythegermansnowman> I never said it was bad because of that @horolynnn
[04:21] <vacuiti> moondoggie pls
[04:22] <moondoggie01> blighttown
[04:22] <vacuiti> there
[04:22] <horolynnn> Frostythegermansnowman but you put it in a way that made it sound slike that
[04:22] <vacuiti> there's heaps of areas where you're blocked off for shitty meme reason and caprus demon or w/e was cancer
[04:22] <moondoggie01> you could skip like 80% of that place if you didnt like it
[04:22] <heliconpath> so is this game a boring grind fest with bullet sponges like destiny or??
[04:22] <moondoggie01> Heliconpath looks like it Kappa
[04:23] <horolynnn> there's a lot of criticisms about dark souls 2 that are valid, but I wouldn't say it was easier
[04:23] <horolynnn> if anything, it was more unfair at times
[04:23] <horolynnn> with multi-boss fights
[04:23] <heliconpath> ds2 was easier for most people i think because they had the experience of finishing ds1
[04:23] <horolynnn> and masses of monsters
[04:23] <horolynnn> that might be true
[04:23] <moondoggie01> Horolynnn i found the hitboxes were no where near on point as DS1 and the animations were more flashy but not as fast
[04:23] <nintendojitsu> Dark Souls 3 gameplay reminds me of Dark Souls 2
[04:24] <s0fa_king> https://twitter.com/DarkSoulsGame/status/704668166144675840
[04:24] <bananathugg> Make Darksouls Great again
[04:25] <s0fa_king> can they..
[04:25] <s0fa_king> inb4 dual spear stun locks.
[04:25] <horolynnn> dark souls 2 introduced a lot of changes both from the technical and design standpoints that I and many people didn't agree with
[04:25] <nintendojitsu> it all looks very linear and boring. I miss the exploration
[04:25] <horolynnn> I don't really care much about that personally
[04:25] <iamgoaticus> Dark Souls 1 masterpiece Dark Souls 2 shitty sequel
[04:25] <horolynnn> I play dark souls only for the boss fights
[04:25] <johnspecter> lol
[04:26] <vacuiti> there's a problem with discussing it i think because so many people just say other peoples opinions aren't legit coz "lol git gud"
[04:26] <horolynnn> Iamgoaticus that is simplifying it way too much, but I guess the only thing you're capable of is spouting pointless shit so whatever
[04:26] <nintendojitsu> Dark Souls 3 is definitely the sequel to Dark souls 2
[04:26] <destiny_bot> Destiny updates YouTube regularly now! "Politics, electoral college (USA) and gerrymandering" posted 12h 26m ago youtu.be/b7g2Z0ATeZQ
[04:26] <iamgoaticus> U mad Horolynnn?
[04:26] <gawntlet> am I allowed to say that I loved b-b-both dark souls 1 and 2.. VoHiYo
[04:26] <eatoats> no
[04:26] <memegotchi> VoHiYo
[04:27] <terrorsphere> FlankerZ
[04:27] <vacuiti> kill urself gawntlet git gud
[04:27] <horolynnn> of course not, it's the internet
[04:27] <wagglez> i agree since 31 comes after 2-3
[04:27] <frostythegermansnowman> FrankerZ FrankerZ FrankerZ
[04:27] <nintendojitsu> yes but that doesn't make it weird
[04:27] <horolynnn> you can't like things others don't
[04:27] <terrorsphere> It goes it goes it goes it goes
[04:27] <s0fa_king> I think you need to beat the game more than once and participate in some fight clubs to get a good feel of dark souls 1
[04:27] <spess1> YUH
[04:27] <cu4u> ds2 was forgettable compared to ds 1
[04:27] <iamgoaticus> The best part of Dark Souls 2 is Shalquoir
[04:27] <nintendojitsu> next wave
[04:27] <horolynnn> S0FA_KING I don't, there's a lot of people that play dark souls for pve
[04:27] <horolynnn> and never touch pvp
[04:27] <yoloswaggins1437> FUCK! They killed ALEX!
[04:27] <gawntlet> What game you're all looking forward to this year?
[04:28] <nintendojitsu> more are coming
[04:28] <gawntlet> Doom
[04:28] <gawntlet> (and ds3)
[04:29] <johnspecter> hmm
[04:29] <diarrhea_holocaust> warhammer total war
[04:29] <s0fa_king> Horolynnn Dark souls is an old game and from what i experienced pvp is what kept the game " alive"
[04:29] <johnspecter> nothing really
[04:29] <nintendojitsu> Zelda U
[04:29] <somtozu> >Be Twitch chat viewer
[04:29] <johnspecter> im going to try legion when that comes out
[04:29] <johnspecter> WoW exp
[04:29] <vacuiti> pokemon sun
[04:29] <somtozu> >Tfw can't meme square
[04:29] <somtozu> DuckerZ
[04:29] <horolynnn> I don't know why does the game need to be "alive" for you to enjoy it
[04:29] <vacuiti> because he has no friends
[04:29] <iamgoaticus> I enjoyed doing all kinds of different runs in the souls game, you gotta have your own head cannon for what you're doing
[04:29] <horolynnn> I liked the concept of pvp in dark souls, but the lag makes it unbearable
[04:29] <horolynnn> and yeah, you can say "just get used to it"
[04:29] <madvillain27> do you guys have an aftershave itchiness remedy
[04:30] <horolynnn> but to that I say "fuck no, it's stupid"
[04:30] <nintendojitsu> take out the sniper
[04:30] <johnspecter> what do you use to shave madvillain
[04:30] <vacuiti> a knife
[04:30] <gawntlet> Madvillain27 i dont know if you must use it but i never even use aftershave
[04:30] <s0fa_king> @Horolynnn Some people want to play the game some more after they beat it.
[04:30] <johnspecter> shaving cream? or what
[04:30] <madvillain27> ya
[04:30] <horolynnn> I finished the game multiple times
[04:30] <johnspecter> also, i like to take a shower AFTER shaving
[04:30] <johnspecter> feels good
[04:30] <horolynnn> and I attempted some challenge runs
[04:30] <horolynnn> I don't need other players to enjoy it
[04:31] <nintendojitsu> throw down some flash and fire grenades
[04:31] <horolynnn> I enjoyed it after I beat it, without anyone
[04:31] <horolynnn> wow, that sounds weird
[04:31] <eatoats> why is video quality so bad on Ubuntu?
[04:31] <memegotchi> nathanDubs1 nathanDubs2 nathanDubs3
[04:31] <johnspecter> nathanDubs1 nathanDubs2 nathanDubs3
[04:31] <nintendojitsu> I can't wait until they get their shit pushed in by the yellows
[04:32] <pruyn> so close
[04:32] <nintendojitsu> @Eatoats it's like that for you too?
[04:32] <s0fa_king> @Horolynnn I stayed mostly for the invades and the streamers that hosted fight clubs
[04:32] <johnspecter> running ubuntu for fun @EatOats ?
[04:33] <horolynnn> well then, that just shows that the game can be enjoyed in different ways
[04:33] <eatoats> yes and yes
[04:33] <horolynnn> who's to say that yours or mine way is better
[04:33] <johnspecter> it shouldn't be worse
[04:33] <johnspecter> are you running at your monitors resolution ?
[04:33] <s0fa_king> @Horolynnn does dark souls 2 have that ?
[04:33] <eatoats> yeah resolution is all set correctly
[04:34] <horolynnn> I have no idea as I was never a part of the pvp community
[04:34] <johnspecter> ubuntu should be fine. drivers can be annoying some times
[04:34] <horolynnn> I heard some people preferred ds2 pvp
[04:34] <johnspecter> on linux
[04:34] <s0fa_king> Kappa\
[04:34] <eatoats> yeah I have to poke around some more I guess
[04:34] <lemmiiwinks> 330 am. Fuck you daylight savings time ResidentSleeper
[04:34] <s0fa_king> Kaaapaaaaa\
[04:34] <nintendojitsu> switching to my native res helped
[04:34] <s0fa_king> > dark souls 2 pvp system
[04:34] <horolynnn> > meme arrows
[04:35] <horolynnn> please
06[04:35] * lemmiiwinks >
[04:35] <s0fa_king> daaaaaank memes
06[04:35] * johnspecter ><
[04:35] <memegotchi> Sweatstiny
[04:35] <lizardwrath> im clenched
[04:35] <horolynnn> there were people that enjoyed ds2 pvp system more, that's undeniably true
[04:35] <horolynnn> you can't fucking say they weren't, because there were
[04:36] <nintendojitsu> toss a grenade
[04:36] <s0fa_king> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huNdnoP8r60
[04:36] <horolynnn> I'm not in a position to assess them both objectively as, like I said I was never a part of the pvp community
[04:36] <destiny_bot> Destiny has a new Twitter! twitter.com/OmniDestiny
[04:36] <horolynnn> wow one video, thanks
[04:36] <horolynnn> that concludes it, no one ever liked ds 2 pvp
[04:36] <horolynnn> you got me
[04:36] <johnspecter> I wasn't even aware dark souls had PvP haha
[04:37] <nintendojitsu> For a team, they are dangerously underleveled
[04:37] <s0fa_king> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbVkDEb9FLg
[04:37] <horolynnn> and like I said previously, those games can be enjoyed in different ways
[04:37] <horolynnn> why are you trying to push your narrative of "no one likes ds 2 pvp cause it's shit"
[04:37] <s0fa_king> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwjtaH0OTWk
[04:37] <horolynnn> when pvp is not all that matters
[04:37] <iceli3> Don't tell me that yellow bar is its HP?
[04:37] <nintendojitsu> fire melts shields
[04:37] <memegotchi> tank meta ResidentSleeper
[04:37] <iceli3> Oh..
[04:38] <horolynnn> dude, you can link all those videos that exist on youtube
[04:38] <horolynnn> and it's not gonna be enough
[04:38] <horolynnn> compared to the amount of people that played that game
[04:38] <nintendojitsu> The Russian consulate is after this
[04:38] <horolynnn> my argument is not that it's better than ds1 pvp in every way, it's that there were people that enjoyed it more
[04:38] <smugsub_elnubnub> You were 21
[04:38] <xiondisc> Wow, this game is s- ResidentSleeper
[04:38] <r00gle> wooo teamwork
[04:39] <iamgoaticus> fan boy alert
[04:39] <r00gle> wheren't you 19 ?
[04:39] <nintendojitsu> he was 21
[04:39] <r00gle> ahh :(
[04:39] <escensse> Destiny doesn't read this chat by the way he has his own private chat at www.destiny.gg
[04:40] <gawntlet> cmonBruh
[04:40] <toxicherpes> rigged
[04:40] <johnspecter> He does read this chat, just not as often
[04:40] <taichouloki> ^LIES
[04:40] <taichouloki> KappaPride
[04:40] <rogueplz> @destinyremember when you sent dic pics to a girl? all over the internet
[04:40] <thunderbarel> Oh yes
[04:40] <robbied_> Is this game worth it????
[04:41] <johnspecter> FeelsBadMan
[04:41] <musty_badger> Let's dispel the fiction that Destiny doesn't read this chat.
[04:41] <toxicherpes> Robbied_, no
[04:41] <robbied_> @toxicherpes why
[04:41] <johnspecter> Lets watch the Bernie video @Destiny
[04:41] <toxicherpes> Robbied_, over hyped probably die down after a month or two
[04:42] <thunderbarel> Fuk you destiny
[04:42] <nintendojitsu> I don't think the game is worth it. Not $60 mind you. Once the single player is done, there isn't much to do but Dark Zone BS. hopefully, future updates will flesh it out more
[04:42] <toxicherpes> ^
[04:42] <illfrostylll> darkzone??
[04:42] <robbied_> @toxicherpes I need a new game ffs
[04:43] <toxicherpes> Robbied_, buy it if you dont care about $60
[04:43] <nintendojitsu> Not enough gameplay variety to keep me interested for long
[04:43] <illfrostylll> haha youre stupid
[04:43] <nintendojitsu> Dark Zone is the PVP area
[04:43] <thebunz> DS3 is out in like 10 days just wait for that
[04:43] <musty_badger> @robbied_ there are a lot of mixed views on this game tbh, I like the game a lot
[04:43] <horolynnn> if you're gonna play it by yourself you're probably gonna get bored pretty fast
[04:43] <przeciezwiesz3> tfw darkzone requires friends to play with FeelsBadMan
[04:43] <illfrostylll> this game is an MMO
[04:43] <illfrostylll> play with friends
[04:43] <nintendojitsu> @Horolynnn that's probably why i did get bored so fast
[04:44] <toxicherpes> no friends FeelsBadMan
[04:44] <illfrostylll> or get ran over by other groups
[04:44] <nintendojitsu> Final boss was fun doe
[04:44] <horolynnn> there's fun to be had coordinating things with a group

[04:46] <bananathugg> Bernie even says it after a pause between the ghetto comment
[04:46] <destiny_bot> Robot Lady will read your message for $5 or more donations twitchalerts.com/donate/destiny
[04:46] <kreegath> What is he talking about, though? Do you understand what he is talking about?
[04:46] <mcgraczu> wow, I go to sleep, this guy streams, I wake up, this guy still streams :o
[04:46] <ozcollo> Yeah, that sounds pretty fucking stupid. I've experienced it personally...
[04:46] <johnspecter> He'll show the vid
[04:46] <gawntlet> Is Aslan buying a present for Nathan Keepo
[04:46] <nintendojitsu> Central heating over sat comms...
[04:46] <itberawr> I sure wish I was a hot dog
[04:47] <mcgraczu> Destiny, get a job, man, computer games can't feed you NotLikeThis
[04:47] <bananathugg> Im not gonna demonize Bernie as a racist, but he said a stupid thing
[04:47] <bananathugg> But Destiny things his Bernieboy can do no wrong
[04:47] <kreegath> He didn't say that
[04:47] <nintendojitsu> snap judgements on tilt
[04:48] <nintendojitsu> Lemon is an Uncle tom
[04:48] <ironchieftain> this question is so fucking stupid
[04:48] <vincetd> Dodges the question
[04:48] <nintendojitsu> honest answer
[04:48] <itberawr> #Athene truth
[04:48] <mom0momo> WUT?
[04:49] <tazhavoc> the fuck? He talked about racism you bitch, not how to have sex
[04:49] <mcgraczu> this question is basically "show us the white guilt, motherfuckers"
[04:49] <vincetd> lol
[04:49] <johnspecter> Tevon Martin hahahha
[04:49] <tazhavoc> "the talk with your children". "child, you my nigga now"
[04:49] <posesnus> What a completely bullshit question.
[04:49] <s0fa_king> cmonBruh
[04:49] <toxicherpes> LOL
[04:49] <posesnus> There is no way to correctly answer that
[04:49] <nintendojitsu> honest answer is honest
[04:49] <mcgraczu> @Toxicherpes your name reminded me of my ex
[04:49] <moondoggie01> so is there something qualitatively different from when a police officer harasses a poor black person from a poor white person? bernies just trying to score points with black people same as hilary
[04:49] <bananathugg> Destiny pls dont freak out when U see Bernie was actually saying white people dont know what its like to be poor
[04:50] <ironchieftain> FailFish
[04:50] <bananathugg> MiniK
[04:50] <auronj> "stay a while and listen"
[04:50] <johnspecter> @bananathugg, you're funny man
[04:50] <destiny> bananathugg, I already know the entire context of this quote, I watch the entire debate and I'm not a retard. :/
[04:50] <toxicherpes> McGraczU, she had herpes?
[04:50] <destiny> Sorry m8 to disappoint you
[04:50] <spess1> he totally sounds like cain
[04:50] <ellesar78> It's funny how anyone can be hypocritical on the internet but feel offended when someone speaks on racism towards their own race
[04:50] <luxredux> @Moondoggie01, I know, right? I can't see the value in making such a sweeping and pointless generalization, especially in light of all this "white privilege" bullshit flying around.
[04:50] <moneyddragon> why so many dislike
[04:50] <bananathugg> http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/07/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-wrong-say-when-youre-white-you-dont/
[04:50] <xander004> Kappa
[04:50] <mcgraczu> @Toxicherpes yes, ToxicHerpes even
[04:50] <bananathugg> Politifacts made that whole thing for no reason?
[04:50] <johnspecter> im glad to see the actual video
[04:50] <tazhavoc> destiny you sure about that? KappaPride
[04:50] <bananathugg> should have just said, "Thats not what he meant :^)"
[04:50] <itberawr> Non gaming content pls
[04:51] <shadakh> Well moondoggie supposedly white and black people do the same amount of drug offences, but black people get put away disproportionately more for the same crimes, are more likely to receive death penalty etc
[04:51] <gawntlet> Bernie Stories FeelsGoodMan
[04:51] <destiny> bananathugg, you realize he released a statement literally the next day clarifying, yeah?
[04:51] <bananathugg> Clarifying his misstatement
[04:51] <bananathugg> he misspoke but said what he said m8
[04:51] <nintendojitsu> I have honestly never heard Sanders speak. Where is that accent from I'm hearing?
[04:51] <destiny> It's so sad that any reasonably intelligent person knows exactly what he's talking about here.
[04:51] <garrex28> hes from vermont
[04:51] <decoyfordateline> 2016
[04:51] <nintendojitsu> makes sense now
[04:51] <bananathugg> I dont actually think he thinks theres no poor white people
[04:51] <garrex28> he has that new england accent
[04:52] <spess1> he clearly doesn't think "LITERALLY NO PEOPLE WHO ARE WHITE ARE IN POVEWRTY"
[04:52] <bananathugg> but he said it.
[04:52] <moondoggie01> Shadakh yeah he should have just made that actual point instead of dumb political pandering speak
[04:52] <theslinger12> Larry David for president
[04:52] <mcgraczu> What about Bernie and the Muslim problem? Have you been to Europe lately?
[04:52] <johnspecter> he said it in a retarded way but yeah its understandable
[04:52] <vincetd> They will never fix criminal justice system
[04:53] <johnspecter> yeah that question was ridiculous.
[04:53] <ozcollo> It was a stupid fucking statement man
[04:53] <vincetd> Hey Destiny what's good man, can a brotha get a shot out?
[04:53] <ozcollo> poorly worded to say the least
[04:53] <dizziestdust> Bernie wants to take away money from those who worked for their money
[04:53] <bananathugg> Destiny, Trump and others say stupid shit like that all the time, yet you never give them the benefit of the doubt
[04:53] <itberawr> I find it funny people actually support Trump, and a little sad.
[04:53] <bananathugg> When we defend it, its mental gymnastics. When you do, its common fucking sense?
[04:53] <bananathugg> nice meme :^)
[04:54] <fleshygordon> weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeew
[04:54] <posesnus> Why are they asking questions like this, that are only designed to be traps?
[04:54] <moneyddragon> Real talk with Destiny
[04:54] <shadakh> Yeah true, was a stupid statement to make, but I guess you hAve to look at it with the background of what a person has worked with in the past
[04:54] <spess1> pretty much

[04:55] <auronj> If you can't see the level of Trumps stupidity... wooo haha.
[04:55] <shadakh> He's obviously worked on behalf of poor black and white people before, so it's not as if he's gonna forget the white people. Who were likely the majority
[04:55] <lonelybits> When I see Trumbs rallies all I see is Ignorant and uneducated white people
[04:55] <champeenpapi> what's going on haha
[04:55] <maadyo> What platform

[04:56] <warmenace> its fucking 4 am almost
[04:56] <garrex28> it feels as if this entire argument has been over semantics...it reminds me of the people that jump on grammar mistakes when they run out of rebuttles
[04:56] <bananathugg> Destiny, can you atleast admit that the way he said it was dumb? If someone never saw Bernie sanders talk, how do you think they would take his comment? Its not about the whole picture, I know Bernie isnt a racist from 1 dumb comment. But it was still a badly made statement
[04:56] <gawntlet> Warmenace yep. its 1 56 am here.soon to be 3 am 4Head

[04:58] <dnabios> Destiny was defending Bernies "white people don't know poverty" comment.
[04:58] <alterz_ego> Is he still mad about wasting money on bernie's campaign?
[04:58] <rayjayswag> poor white people?
[04:58] <ironchieftain> it's ok Trumples, when Bernie becomes president you can get the mental health care you need EleGiggle
[04:58] <ironchieftain> DuckerZ
[04:59] <ibanez5262> he's mad because he's not going to get free shit from Bernie and make us pay for it
[04:59] <docjdaws90> @ibanez5262 yeeeeeee hawwww fuck y'all
[04:59] <mom0momo> What does XOXO mean?
[04:59] <johnspecter> nothing is free
[04:59] <rayjayswag> bernie has no shot
[04:59] <rayjayswag> good luck though
[04:59] <ibanez5262> scum freeloader Bernie cucks
[04:59] <happy_howard> Is destinys twitch chat just a collection of the hyper-sperg-burglars that get banned from destinygg chat
[04:59] <hulk9969> Not a trump fan but Bernie would fuck our country up as well
[04:59] <ironchieftain> we'll see on the 15th
[04:59] <moondoggie01> Happy_howard i think so lol
[05:00] <ironchieftain> i don't see how people can make these assumptions with no evidence
[05:00] <wreckoon> are you implying your country is okay as it is?
[05:00] <happy_howard> Hey shit head Americans did u know democratic socialism works? -Canada
[05:00] <ibanez5262> all I hear is cuck cuck give me money Bernie at the expense of the successful people cuck
[05:00] <moondoggie01> Happy_howard if i knew i was going to get banned i would have gone out with some danker memes i just said some pretty innocuous shit but he was already rustled i guess
[05:01] <johnspecter> you could say that about any country @wreckoon
[05:01] <wreckoon> then you can't say he can fuck it up, can you
[05:01] <hulk9969> Every country has its issues, it's election season, issues will be blown up more than ever
[05:01] <johnspecter> i made no comment about anyone fucking anything up wtf
[05:01] <happy_howard> I only look at this chat when in in bed or on the toilet, and every time I do, it's always a little bit worse
[05:02] <ibanez5262> Der Der Der. er
[05:02] <ibanez5262> Bernie pls
[05:02] <dnabios> oh no, it could be fucked up much worse
[05:02] <hulk9969> He can def fuck it up by raising taxes even more and raising minimum wage
[05:02] <ibanez5262> tax me more so I don't have to work then I won't pay taxes at all
[05:02] <ibanez5262> pls Bernie give me more I don't want to work
[05:03] <happy_howard> Nice centipede memes bro
[05:03] <ibanez5262> this best buy job is too hard
[05:03] <ibanez5262> not equal
[05:03] <happy_howard> @ibanez5262 bro where do you work
[05:03] <johnspecter> No one should be without health care.
[05:04] <ibanez5262> Bernie pls make minimum wage higher so I can support my family working at McDonald's because I never had drive to gain any meaningful skills
[05:04] <ibanez5262> I have 8 kids Bernie pls give me free shit
[05:04] <happy_howard> @johnspecter I'd have been pretty fucked without my free colonoscopy tbh
[05:04] <ironchieftain> apparently people forget about the economic crisis of 2007-8, or the fact that billion dollar companies are paying less in taxes than working people
[05:05] <johnspecter> @happy_howard, they found some pre cancerous stuff in there?
[05:05] <hulk9969> I agree that corporate taxes should be raised
[05:05] <hulk9969> But not income
[05:05] <hulk9969> Plus 1 percenters have resources we don't and can manipulate the system regardless of the circumstances
[05:06] <ibanez5262> you do realize that the top 20 percent of income earners pay 85 percent of the nation's taxes
[05:06] <destiny_bot> Destiny updates YouTube regularly now! "Politics, electoral college (USA) and gerrymandering" posted 13h 6m ago youtu.be/b7g2Z0ATeZQ
[05:06] <ibanez5262> the Bernie scum don't even pay tax already and they want to raise it
[05:07] <ibanez5262> free stuff pls Bernie mom didn't teach me to work plssss
[05:07] <memegotchi> VoHiYo
[05:07] <hulk9969> I respect bernie as a man and leader but his policies and promises he is making are not possible or attract untrue
[05:07] <wreckoon> you're repeating the same old anti-socialist memes, nothing of substance
[05:07] <wreckoon> why don't you just die
[05:07] <hulk9969> *atleast
[05:08] <ibanez5262> Lol no rebuttal to the science of current taxation just die. typical Bernie cuck
[05:08] <ironchieftain> maybe because they have all the money?
[05:08] <hulk9969> Me wreckon?
[05:08] <wreckoon> im not even living anywhere near america, i dont care, you are the cuck
[05:09] <ibanez5262> wahhh
[05:09] <ironchieftain> i mean how can people with no wealth pay the taxes if they have no money? it isn't because they don't work, people work 2-3 jobs
[05:09] <johnspecter> I don't like taxes either, but its in our best interest to have everyone covered for HEALTH CARE at the very least.
[05:09] <destiny> 4:06 TimeoutBan Ibanez5262: the Bernie scum don't even pay tax already and they want to raise it
[05:09] <destiny> You have no idea what it's like to be poor, why bother commenting on it?
[05:09] <hulk9969> No Johnspecter it's not
[05:09] <memegotchi> outsource healthcare to canada nathanDank
[05:09] <ibanez5262> wahhh
[05:10] <destiny> It's hilarious when entitled little college fuckers who've had mommy and daddy pay for everything in their life until they're 23 try to act like they know anything about working or being poor.
[05:10] <lordlynkz> preach!
[05:10] <ibanez5262> Lol I took loans and paid my debt. you're the uninformed "college" Bernie cuck dropout
[05:11] <happy_howard> My app crashed. Who asked about my ass cancer
[05:11] <ibanez5262> hope your ass cancer is okay bud
[05:11] <destiny> https://plus.google.com/105701980252961997147/posts?pid=5654632957683180402&oid=105701980252961997147
[05:11] <happy_howard> Thanks
[05:11] <destiny> nice dog Ibanez5262
[05:11] <happy_howard> Turns out I don't have any
[05:11] <destiny> did mommy fit that suit for you?
[05:11] <hulk9969> @destiny you cannot stick up for the individuals who just sit at home and collect welfare can you?
[05:11] <happy_howard> But I wouldn't have known without my single payer Medicare
[05:11] <destiny> Hulk9969, no but a lot of the working poor aren't like that
[05:12] <destiny> that's just a narrative pushed by the Republitards
[05:12] <hulk9969> I agree
[05:12] <happy_howard> Destiny I didn't know you interacted with this chat
[05:12] <escensse> Im poor i cant afford to pay my rent please richpeople donate to me kk
[05:12] <johnspecter> He watches both chats
[05:13] <lordlynkz> I mean some people work full time jobs and still can't make ends meet
[05:13] <lordlynkz> Like rent , food , communication, car
[05:13] <johnspecter> yeah its tough out there
[05:13] <lordlynkz> Or they live paycheck to paycheck
[05:14] <lordlynkz> Living in a city is tough .
[05:14] <hulk9969> But at the end of the day, this is life, and we all get dealt different hands. I'm a middle class college grad working at a bank who has no debt but I worked my ass off during school. I know ppl have it easier than me and others have it harder but there should be no handouts for lazy ppl who do not like
[05:14] <happy_howard> I live somewhere where cost of living is extremely low. I can only imagine
[05:14] <wreckoon> there are people who work fulltime and make less money than they would from sitting on their asses and collect welfare
[05:14] <wreckoon> but are too ashamed to do it
[05:14] <hulk9969> To do anything but sit and complain about the system
[05:15] <lordlynkz> a lot of poor people live and die where they are born
[05:15] <lordlynkz> They aren't nomads who just up and leave
[05:15] <lordlynkz> with sometimes limited education all they know are their friends and neighbors
[05:16] <lordlynkz> literally all they have is that group of people
[05:16] <johnspecter> who was the guy who said it isn't in our best interest to have everyone covered with health care?
[05:16] <destiny_bot> Destiny has a new Twitter! twitter.com/OmniDestiny
[05:17] <johnspecter> to the guy who said that, you want people to be healthy around you do you not?
[05:17] <lordlynkz> Poor people just don't up and move on a whim with no safety net, they are so used to living under the rule of "one false move and it's all over for you and your family"
[05:18] <lordlynkz> many of my friends had to choose between school or helping provide for their family
[05:18] <lordlynkz> Cause in the poor people world it's about survival
[05:18] <johnspecter> thats rough
[05:18] <lordlynkz> Not comfort, not legacy,
[05:19] <lordlynkz> That's all things you get after stability
[05:19] <johnspecter> did everyone bail?
[05:19] <johnspecter> she we be leaving too?
[05:19] <johnspecter> should*
[05:19] <happy_howard> I'm so thankful for what I have BibleThump
[05:19] <lordlynkz> please be thankful
[05:19] <lordlynkz> Life is vast
[05:20] <happy_howard> I've lived my whole live in this mobile home
[05:20] <lordlynkz> And perception is a mother fucker
[05:20] <lordlynkz> mobile homes are nothing to sneeze at
[05:20] <johnspecter> at least you have internet!
[05:20] <happy_howard> And today I phoned my grandpa and he agreed to pay for all of my uni tuition
[05:20] <lordlynkz> for the most part cheap living
[05:20] <johnspecter> nice howard
[05:21] <happy_howard> It's great dude. You get used to the rats
[05:21] <lordlynkz> cmonBruh you memeing me boy
[05:21] <johnspecter> who knows
[05:21] <johnspecter> but w/e
[05:22] <lordlynkz> I had a very close friend live in a trailer park... rats did not follow... trailer parks are just like any other living enclave
[05:22] <happy_howard> When I get a job, first one getting payed is momma
[05:22] <happy_howard> I have the unfortunate blessing of rats
[05:22] <lordlynkz> a lot of poor families have that going
[05:23] <lordlynkz> Get a job money goes the the head of house
[05:23] <johnspecter> do you guys put out traps?
[05:23] <happy_howard> Ya. Traps only do so much
[05:24] <johnspecter> damn
[05:24] <lordlynkz> They coming from a neighbors place?
[05:24] <happy_howard> I gotta call an exterminator tbh
[05:24] <johnspecter> yeah its probably worth it
[05:24] <lordlynkz> time for some deep cleaning ...
[05:24] <johnspecter> HEH
[05:24] <lordlynkz> rats..
[05:24] <lordlynkz> That sucks
[05:24] <johnspecter> maybe get a cat too
[05:24] <happy_howard> There's like a open ground crawls
[05:24] <johnspecter> nathanDank
[05:25] <happy_howard> Crawlspace
[05:25] <happy_howard> Under my trailer
[05:25] <johnspecter> hmm
[05:25] <happy_howard> And all kinds of shit would get in there
[05:25] <johnspecter> maybe the dude will recommend you seal that off
[05:25] <happy_howard> Ya
[05:25] <johnspecter> i gtg, gl howard

[20:56] <tsm_give_me_a_high_five> i don't believe that stuff
[20:56] <natescott430> that makes ign super happy

[20:57] <forevertatsu> lol
[20:57] <tsm_give_me_a_high_five> 9.5 ign would be rare as fuck. nice try though
[20:57] <pokebrah> A 15 year old won the hearthstone NA tournament reaffirming the game's status of "Children's Card Game"
[20:57] <natescott430> LUL
[20:57] <pearninja> where do you find updog in this level?
[20:57] <spooony> nyc is just a shit choice for a videogame. its city layout is boring.
[20:57] <nintendojitsu> lies
[20:57] <akademiker> RNG BASED CARD GAME
[20:57] <natescott430> pokebrah, was it ever not a children's card game?
[20:57] <natescott430> LUL
[20:58] <pokebrah> no but this removed all doubt 4Head

[20:59] <liquidfire92> KappaPride
[20:59] <kingredbad> @TSM_Give_Me_A_High_Five, if a regular RPG has trouble not being repetitive, what kind of chance does a shooter like The Division have?
[20:59] <posesnus> Its always funny seeing people give HS shit for being a kids game, as they´re sitting on their nintendo 3DS playing pokemon 4Head
[21:00] <tsm_give_me_a_high_five> exactly king, why i fear it. must be repetitive as hell
[21:00] <crippetv> what is the best assault riftle and sniper in the game? @destiny
[21:00] <mangomosh> Posesnus, thats literally me LUL
[21:01] <nintendojitsu> seriously underleveled
[21:01] <mach_jentra> AI LUL
[21:01] <tsm_give_me_a_high_five> i'm the dude that still plays dust 2 though.
[21:01] <spooony> pokemon isn't presented as something its not. hs has tournamnts produced like the ga e is actually skilled based and highly intelligent
[21:01] <cliffpaul33> OSkomodo Hi$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
[21:02] <jurgen_kuksson> is destiny milhouse for real
[21:02] <jurgen_kuksson> forced memes get it
[21:02] <nintendojitsu> the helicopter is going to fuck them up
[21:02] <kappakingprime> Hhhehehe
[21:02] <posesnus> How is HS not presented as a kids game?
[21:03] <spooony> because the tournaments present it like a serious esport
[21:03] <posesnus> so does pokemon
[21:03] <posesnus> its jut not as big
[21:03] <spooony> pokemon barely has tournaments
[21:03] <posesnus> thats true, but its not any less serious.
[21:03] <posesnus> I´d say people take it more serious
[21:04] <demagogue11> Cute you think a blizzard game takes the tournament side seriously Kappa
[21:04] <noreseto> game looks really repetitive
[21:04] <tsm_give_me_a_high_five> i play HS on mobile only basically..... that and poker make DMV trips and such much easier.
[21:04] <posesnus> HS is a great mobile game.
[21:05] <chiefcoco> hs?

[21:05] <natescott430> TSM_Give_Me_A_High_Five, oh, fuck my reading. I
[21:06] <natescott430> I would actually disagree, because for me at least, hearthstone takes too long with deckbuilding and grinding packs to be a fun timepasser
[21:06] <pearninja> outside has the best rpg
[21:06] <zkxtylenol> not 30 yet? wtf?!
[21:06] <mar45690> @everyonelovesprime PogChamp

[21:08] <nintendojitsu> I played solo. Finished story at lvl 28
[21:08] <natescott430> Posesnus, yeah, what I meant was you gotta grind the cards or buy packs in order to even get the cards to build decks
[21:08] <mar45690> @posesnus yeah cause people want to win 4Head
[21:08] <posesnus> I would play secret pally, if i didnt hate it so much

[21:55] <trypsinogen> let bernie speak
[21:56] <goatybay> But the financial crisis was caused by Bill Clintons deregulation of wall street
[21:56] <biscu_> Who went first clinton or sanders?
[21:56] <allonuss> can bernie even live out a full term?
[21:56] <hashbeansc2> bill clinton and the banks during his administration were the ones who nearly bankrupt the housing industry
[21:56] <bert_bert_bert> regardless of what hilary stands for, i cant stand her tone of voice and choice of words. it rustles me so hard
[21:56] <trypsinogen> he looks healthy enough

[22:20] <natescott430> deIlluminati
[22:20] <orcishtv> Yoshi27, are you suggesting 25% of voters in an election can't actually be nazis?
[22:20] <kizea> @Yoshi27, that party got 3/4 of their votes because voters wanted to shock other parties, nothing else
[22:20] <biggusigus> Merkal herself was part of soviet indoctrination classes. 90% of the party is aswell
[22:20] <allonuss> yoshi ur too naive
[22:20] <shadakh> The trouble is, a lot of the people who have been the most vocal about immigrants of all sorts in the last 30 years have turned it into a total boy who cried wolf situation. And yeah, they were pretty racist. That's why objectors to the current crises may, sometimes mistakenly, be called racist
[22:21] <yoshi27> i have no evidence do belive their nazis so i wouldnt call them that, again it doesnt stop people who simply disagree with their opinion to call them nazi/ xenophobic which are serious libelous terms SIMPLY because they disagree
[22:21] <shadakh> Let's not pretend that the thousand and one times the far right has bitched about migrants, that they've been right even 10% of the time
[22:21] <shadakh> That considered, I do think the current crisis is different and needs to be handled different
[22:21] <shadakh> Differently *
[22:21] <kizea> @Yoshi27, we call them like that because they are the same kind of fearmonger right now

At least to my knowledge they're not betting the refugees thoroughly to make sure they're compatible with German life and giving stay permits to way too many at once, which will create vast societal problems especially since Germany isn't growing fast enough to provide jobs and integrate all of these people.

[22:27] <natescott430> Kizea, praise be to bee bUrself
[22:27] <allonuss> german politics EleGiggle
[22:27] <babydrool> I feel that the way its being handled currently is in no way appropriate but we do have to help refugees of war. We can't just leave them to starve.
[22:27] <gholatrooper> I was born too late to explore the earth, too early to explore the universe, the only thing i was born in time to do, is browse dank memes
[22:27] <vacuiti> destiny hurry up and kill people this is boring
[22:28] <thelegendarylurker_> @Shadakh Many of the disputes are actually ethnic in origin and go back many hundreds of years
[22:28] <kizea> @NateScott430, bUrself
[22:28] <biggusigus> Keep it real here... most of Europe is a lost cause. The politicians or the electoral system are either broken or corrupt. The majority of the people have also been heavily indoctrinated with socialist propaganda
[22:28] <natescott430> DuckerZ
[22:28] <biggusigus> Just look at the recent elections in the UK
[22:28] <everyonelovesmvp> mfw germany goes apeshit cuz of a party who wont govern anyway EleGiggle
[22:28] <vacuiti> DuckerZ
[22:28] <natescott430> Biggusigus, no thanks, I don't pay attention to losers Keepo
[22:28] <shadakh> @thelegendarylurker_ I don't think it's particularly a religion that is causing it. It's the culture as you say. Indonesia is a lot better off than the ME for example
[22:28] <biggusigus> UKIP lost because the First Past the Post system HEAVILY favours big parties or established ones
[22:28] <destiny_bot> Destiny updates YouTube regularly now! "DayZ - The Return of the King" posted 7h 28m ago youtu.be/UBVoAA9nvoM
[22:29] <yoshi27> listen kizea the fact of the matter is, your own people are voicing their opinion through this 25% votes and their being attacked for holding this belief, admittedly i dont know exactly wahts going on because im American and give little fucks about germoney, shows how toxic of an environmen it is and i bet many more are scared to voice their opinions in fear of facing this backlash/ridicule
[22:29] <padwardoc> Biggusigus, "indoctrinated with socialist prop." and the conservative party was elected, consider leaving this chat
[22:29] <drfell> ukip lost because no one voted for them
[22:29] <shadakh> But the culture, the religion and the politics are way too combined over there. Until they learn u gotta separate that shit, they will stay fucked
[22:29] <biggusigus> It doesnt matter whose elected when schools are literally cesspools of socialist propaganda, its not even memeing
[22:30] <everyonelovesmvp> Yoshi27, he cant accept the fact that people have different opinions just let him be
[22:30] <biggusigus> you can pull up any article from the web and see for yourself.
[22:30] <drfell> nvm Biggusigus is baiting
[22:30] <melissus> destiny has lost faith in the america people FeelsBadMan
[22:30] <melissus> american*
[22:30] <kizea> @Yoshi27, it's not 25% you cuck. It's a maximum of 25% in one of three districts that got a "huge" amount of votes. We got a total of 16 districts.
[22:30] <babydrool> What Germany should have done is what the US did with refugees from the Balkan War. Build camps in military bases and house them temporarily. And then we can start betting those more highly in need stringently.
[22:30] <esoterikk> It started as a meme
[22:30] <protein_egg> >Leddit DuckerZ
[22:30] <gholatrooper> Dont wory @Melissus he will regain faith once Dolando makes it great again PogChamp
[22:30] <esoterikk> then people took it serious
[22:30] <king_kappa_prime> is destiny in the dark zone?
[22:31] <owlet6> lol it's an actual subreddit
[22:31] <melissus> a subreddit where you can't tell where the memes ends and the trump presidency dreams begin
[22:31] <thelegendarylurker_> @Shadakh i agree but those things arent even separated in america, tons of politicians claim to be christian and base their decisions on the bible
[22:31] <yoshi27> destiny dont compare the sanders one which is literally nothing but hey guys i donated to a socialist, im probably not even american too but nobody cares!!
[22:31] <mom0momo> Hey fam!
[22:31] <yoshi27> 24/7
[22:31] <mom0momo> OuO
[22:31] <everyonelovesmvp> MoM0MoMo, VoHiYo
[22:32] <brock4ever> its illegal to donate if you're non-american
[22:32] <kamunster> OuO
[22:32] <everyonelovesmvp> OuO
[22:32] <protein_egg> OuO
[22:32] <shadakh> @thelegendarylurker_ but the people don't let them combine them too much. Hence why abortion is legal even when they try so hard to outlaw it. Ditto with sex ed, contraception etc. You wouldn't see that amount of opposition to the establishment in the ME
[22:32] <dhanik60> sanders has a lot of shitty humans supporting him but hes not a bad guy
[22:32] <melissus> it's only legal for foreigners to donate to american lobbying organizations who then donate to the candidates Kappa @Brock4ever

[22:34] <dhanik60> he hates overwatch

[22:34] <mom0momo> I'm On my way! Home
[22:34] <potioncellar> You can be religious and be logical / without faith. @thelegendarylurker_
[22:34] <kappast> how do you pronounce "laffer" Kappa
[22:34] <mom0momo> Did Hillary win tonight?
[22:35] <yoshi27> theres no way sanders doesnt receive donations from non american citizens, it's nothing i can quantifiable prove however being that they would be private transactions, but americans arent socialists it's highly supported by other cuck countries https://twitter.com/desRowfighting/status/697993818705170432 NOT sure if desrow is an american citizen but theres something
[22:35] <truthiness09> @kappast nice maymay
[22:35] <konjkave> Hi all
[22:35] <gholatrooper> @Yoshi27 Isint Desrow a canuck ?
[22:35] <mom0momo> Hi
[22:35] <melissus> could desrow be an illegal immigrant? ;)
[22:36] <thelegendarylurker_> @Potioncellar which religion doesnt require faith to believe is true? I'm not aware of any that have been proven real
[22:36] <yoshi27> he is from canada for sure.. it's somethign we'd have to find out from him but it's a suspicious case
[22:36] <perfectskye> Taoism
[22:36] <curtsy> Desrow is from Quebec
[22:36] <potioncellar> Christianity? There are a lot of people who are scientists that think the a God causing the Big Bang makes the most logical sense. @thelegendarylurker_
[22:37] <yoshi27> is it possible he has some dual citizenship though? im not 100% certain which is why im a bit resentful of using this as a case in point however he's def canadian
[22:37] <thevanessacarlton> can you give one source on that?
[22:38] <thevanessacarlton> @Potioncellar
[22:38] <curtsy> @Yoshi27, Probably not, both his parents are from there, and he's a 400 pound neet with no real life skills.
[22:38] <yoshi27> NICE RETORT DESTINY HOLY SHIT, CONTAIN THIS MAN HE WENT: ''hmph''!!
[22:38] <thelegendarylurker_> @Potioncellar Christianity encompasses alot more than god causing the big bang. You take alot of unproven information to actually believe in it

[22:40] <potioncellar> @thelegendarylurker_, I used to think the same was as you, that being religious is kinda a negative thing, because of the faith instead of logic thing. Let's say there's a person who believes that God caused the Big Bang because that seems like the most logical thing. How can you get something from nothing? Well, a really powerful being causing it would make sense.
[22:40] <zeffer007> hey destiny...how do you think this game compares to the fun of dayz? (first impressions wise).
[22:40] <natescott430> PotionCellar, Couldn't you say that there is a need for an omnipotent entity in order for an event such as the big bang to occur, based on our current understanding of entropy?
[22:41] <dhanik60> does he like the division?
[22:41] <dhanik60> is it worth $80?
[22:41] <natescott430> or was it reptillians all along? deIlluminati
[22:41] <akademiker> no
[22:41] <potioncellar> @NateScott430, I don't know too much about the Universal theories, but sure! For this thought exercise, we can assume that :)
[22:41] <shadakh> @potioncellar then what created the entity? Turtles all the way down man. No logical connection.
[22:41] <curtsy> He likes it, the game is fun, but there is currently no end game.
[22:41] <kurtisblowme> it looks like its worth like 30$ max
[22:41] <dhanik60> isnt a dlc coming soon?
[22:41] <dhanik60> like in a month or something
[22:41] <akademiker> we are a

[22:41] <everyonelovesmvp> dlc FailFish
[22:41] <akademiker> we are all on a simulation
[22:41] <the_venom_inside> @Destiny, do you know the run down on scavenging in this game? It is similar to magic find in diablo so you can find more high end and purples. Currently am running a setup with 212% so i find three times more high ends
[22:42] <potioncellar> @Shadakh, We make assumptions in science all the time! Something make something illogical if you can explain it.
[22:42] <natescott430> It's worth the money if you're a streamer and will make it back from division meme donations Kappa
[22:42] <everyonelovesmvp> pay for the game and month later you have to buy a dlc FailFish
[22:42] <thelegendarylurker_> @Potioncellar its a sound theory based on our understanding of biology, something doesnt come from nothing but its still unproven. plus once you get in to the whole Jesus stuff and jews as the chosen people....
[22:42] <nigerian419> Is this a Destiny mod?

[22:43] <shadakh> @potioncellar hhose assumptions ions get based on evidence. No evidence suggests there is an additional hand behind the universe. All we know is we are here, the universe is here. It's actually more logical to believe there is a self creating/sustaining way for the universe than to believe it has design, based on our evidence.

[22:44] <thelegendarylurker_> @Potioncellar you brought up christianity, that inherently means you believe in the bible. Sounds like you actually believe in intelligent design.

[22:45] <potioncellar> @thelegendarylurker_, Maybe? Let's say there's a dude who believes in intelligent design, and he likes the teachings of the bible because they align with his own personal morals that he can justify in other ways? I mean, there is a way to be logical as well, right?
[22:45] <roflsstime> lets say god dseosnt fucking exist

[22:46] <thelegendarylurker_> @Potioncellar depends on how he lets those beliefs affect his decisions. HE could make logical decisions and have illogical beliefs i suppose although i would say thats not the norm

[22:46] <goatybay> Agnostic is the way to go
[22:46] <potioncellar> @Shadakh, But we assume a lot, no? Plus, assuming something doesn't necessarily make it illogical, right? If it explains everything it needs to without proof, then it seems quite logical to me.

[22:47] <lumberinglearner> @potioncellar, how can something be logical without evidence?
[22:47] <honkygonewild> You're welcome.
[22:47] <natescott430> Shadakh, I would say otherwise. Based on the evidence we have, we know that the universe has a starting point and that entropy doesn't reverse, meaning it only goes down. There is no evidence that points to entropy being reversed and matter being self-creating. But if there were an omnipotent creator... deIlluminati
[22:47] <shadakh> @potioncellar I don't. I think assuming is a bad idea generally. Think we could do with much less

I'm personally an atheist, and try to live my life based off of logic and reason, but I know people in my personal life who fit the earlier description.

[22:52] <natescott430> Shadakh, if that's what you're referencing.
[22:52] <potioncellar> @Shadakh, Have you ever taken a Psych class? One of the first things I learned is you can't be overly critical, or under critical. You can disprove anything if you try hard enough. You have to assume some things. You assume gravity is true, no?
[22:52] <lumberinglearner> @Akademiker @Potioncellar This is something i'm going to have to go away and think about some more. What does it mean to truly prove something? I think a famous greek mathematician posed this question and Abraham Lincoln read a book on it or something. I think i should read this book and then come back to the discussion.
[22:52] <luxredux> @Destiny, Hey Destiny, so you like this game? What would you give it out of 10?
[22:53] <shadakh> @natescott430 well, kinda. It's more burden of proof increases the more abstract an idea gets from what we see and can do
[22:53] <brock4ever> he said it was 8/8 when he plays with m8s
[22:53] <potioncellar> @Shadakh, If you don't assume anything, you shouldn't believe gravity exists, or that dark matter exists.
[22:53] <akademiker> @lumberinglearner brains are based on connections, the most basic prove has none
[22:53] <veex> if you think skill power is op, you just haven't seen a maxed out player with crit+cirt hit damage and an SMG. people literally drop in .1 second, they don't even get downed anymore.
[22:53] <vyvanny> @PotionCellar, dude you are sounding mad retarded right ow

[22:54] <potioncellar> @Lumberinglearner, Exactly. At some point, you assume the information you are given is true. You assume the scientists telling you and showing you this information is true.

[22:54] <shadakh> @potioncellar I said I try as little as I can. Gravity isn't actually a big idea in terms of abstract thought as the evidence is overwhelming. And yeah I've done 4 years of psych, and I think the discipline could use more empiricism

[22:55] <wreckoon> what is she takes in a hand
[22:55] <potioncellar> @Shadakh, So yeah! You have to make some assumptions in order to believe anything, as you know. So obviously, assuming things doesn't make then illogical based off of that knowledge, right?
[22:55] <ironchieftain> fake women need love too BibleThump
[22:55] <eh_polar_bear> everyonelovesmvp, no, I think anime is trash
[22:55] <shadakh> @potioncellar for me, I don't really care about dark matter. If someone came up with a. More reasonable ideal tomorrow that was better supported I would jump ship immediately. It's not a here-and-now issue. Dark matter isn't telling people to do shit
[22:55] <everyonelovesmvp> eh_polar_bear, but they will never disagree with you :)
[22:55] <aapnet> @eh_polar_bear, I'm not the only one PogChamp
[22:56] <potioncellar> @thelegendarylurker_, I still feel bad for misinterpreting what you meant :( But as long as it's all good :)
[22:56] <eh_polar_bear> everyonelovesmvp, LUL how comforting
[22:56] <decimatedu> 5 slots on the rope
[22:56] <lumberinglearner> @potioncellar I'm not assuming what the scientist say are true, I'm letting them demonstrate what is true based on the evidence and repeatable, quantifiable experiments.
[22:56] <everyonelovesmvp> eh_polar_bear, they are always there for you
[22:56] <akademiker> dark matter IS just a placeholder, you know?
[22:56] <eh_polar_bear> everyonelovesmvp, are they
[22:56] <everyonelovesmvp> eh_polar_bear, yes :3
[22:56] <eh_polar_bear> everyonelovesmvp, fowN
[22:56] <negativenighthawk> destiny you can only extract 4 bags, which means that if someone steals your spot on the extract you can't even extract your shit

[22:57] <everyonelovesmvp> eh_polar_bear, Kreygasm
[22:57] <shadakh> @potioncellar you actually make far too broad strokes with the use of language. Extracting from evidence is not the same as blind assumption. To be scientific about a problem you have to start from a position of knowing nothing and coming from evidence. You are starting from the it ion of already seeing what you want to see
[22:57] <kawaiigrillu> you should probably go to lower area if you want to find players

[22:58] <eh_polar_bear> okay, guys
[22:58] <konjkave> @Potioncellar You are right that you have to make assumptions to reach conclusions, but if there is no supporting evidence then your conclusion is merely conjecture based on complete uncertainty.
[22:58] <yulie355> people are going to be doing Dark Zone shit at max rank
[22:58] <shadakh> @potioncellar basically, substantiated empiricism > this is the idea I like

[22:58] <lumberinglearner> @Potioncellar Science is never about 100% truth, it's about the best possible theory at the time. Theory in the scientific sense, meaning that it's like the theory of gravity it hasn't been disproven yet, it's the best we have so far.

[22:59] <potioncellar> Exactly @Lumberinglearner It's all about the theory that's best at the time! But those change every once in awhile, right? You wouldn't call someone stupid for believing something that science supported until more evidence was found to prove it was wrong? But they were wrong, right?
[22:59] <lumberinglearner> @AAPNet I'm saying science is a work on progress :P
[22:59] <aapnet> @akademiker, LOL ANELE

[23:00] <mitchellpraill1234> holy shit gravity is not a theory its a law that means its true all the time
[23:00] <max1cp> i doubt that many people are lvl 25+ at all

[23:00] <codan1990> deadgame
[23:00] <max1cp> I've played like 10+ hours and I'm only level 12
[23:00] <eh_polar_bear> 10+ and only lvl 12 is not that good
[23:00] <eh_polar_bear> dude, step it up
[23:00] <babyninjajesuz> ur doin it rong
[23:00] <spr1ggs> only 78k LUL
[23:01] <akademiker> theory != "could be wrong"
[23:01] <jayyy_> @Destiny no one is 'tarded enough to try farming dark zone before 30. They are all in the overworld getting 30 first
[23:01] <sanguinius1123> am i the only one who thinks the division is an aweful game?
[23:01] <hyperlethaltv> Any plans to play Overwatch, Destiny?
[23:01] <potioncellar> @konjkave, But if something is the best explanation that we have, based on what we can observe now, is that illogical? That's the whole debate that I'm trying to bring up. A God causing the Big Bang isn't an illogical theory, no?
[23:01] <mitchellpraill1234> a theory is something that hasn't been proven or disproven a law is proven to be true all the time
[23:01] <curtsy> @HyperLethalTV, He didn't like the game/
[23:01] <eh_polar_bear> HyperLethalTV, he did, its called XCOM Kappa
[23:01] <curtsy> So no
[23:01] <akademiker> a theory is an explaination for an effect
[23:02] <angriness> that 78k is only the steam number, their might be a little bit more on just uplay, but probably not many
[23:02] <akademiker> like electrostatic theory
[23:02] <konjkave> @Potioncellar We haven't observed anything that confirms nor denies the existence of a god though.
[23:02] <lumberinglearner> @potioncellar i wouldn't call anyone stupid for following the evidence, but if you have a theory that disproves our current theory then you have to prove it, the responsibility is on you to prove the claim you make.
[23:02] <shadakh> @mitchellpraill1234 hypothesis - educated y - evidence supported hypothesis. Law - condition that is true under a theory
[23:02] <kizea> @eh_polar_bear, niceme.me
[23:02] <akademiker> or theory of airodynamics
[23:02] <eh_polar_bear> airodynamics
[23:02] <potioncellar> So is it illogical to say "this makes the most sense to me"? @konjkave I'm genuinely curious.

[23:02] <allonuss> hhahahaaa
[23:02] <shadakh> @mitchellpraill1234 fucking hell. That was supposed to be hypothesis is an educated guess. Bullshit spell corret

[23:03] <eh_polar_bear> aerodynamics
[23:03] <eh_polar_bear> its okay buddy SeemsGood
[23:03] <konjkave> @Potioncellar You can accept the possibility of it without dogmatically claiming it is an absolute truth yes.

[23:04] <mitchellpraill1234> @Shadakh ok ya so they are taking about god they cant say it is true at best it is a hypothesis not a theory or law

[23:04] <potioncellar> @Lumberinglearner, Sure thing, that's not quite the point I'm getting at. We make a leap of faith and assume stuff at some point. We assume theory 1 is true! We live our lives based off of that theory. But theory 2 comes along and proves that wrong. Even thought theory 1 looked pretty good! So at some point, you have to assume that it's true, or else you would have never believed theory 1 or two. "I think, therefore I am" Is a beautiful thing. It's saying that the only thing that can be proven
[23:04] <eh_polar_bear> everyonelovesmvp, actually, this might be a good time to revive my walk in oven business

[23:05] <eh_polar_bear> and hide any left over unburned "parts"
[23:05] <potioncellar> @konjkave, Awesome! So you think it's logical to think that, right? You wouldn't call something an illogical / non rational / faith based person based off of only the fact that they think that a God caused the Big Bang because it makes the most sense.
[23:05] <everyonelovesmvp> eh_polar_bear, we can send the ashes to jerusalem for family research EleGiggle
[23:06] <shadakh> @potioncellar actually that's not what descartes meant when he said that. he meant that everything could be fake, but the only thing we can take as true is that we think, so we exist. Not that things we think about have to exist
[23:06] <eh_polar_bear> everyonelovesmvp, LUL
[23:06] <commonwest> I need some help. should i pick up the Police MK15 blueprints? i dont have a secondary high end weapon.
[23:06] <alexnovalicious> there's no pvp

[23:06] <decimatedu> i cant wait to watch you guys just hit 30 and go into the dz and try to even kill 1 geared person
[23:06] <ikkisftw> you lose shit ton amount for just killing one guy as rogue and dying
[23:06] <thor393> That will probably change as more people hit level 30
[23:06] <potioncellar> Right, that's what I meant. Guess my wording was off a bit? I feel like it made sense. Either way, exactly! So to believe anything, you have to assume some stuff :) That's all I'm trying to say.
[23:07] <konjkave> @Potioncellar No, I don't think it is a logical conclusion at this time because there is nothing you can do to demonstrate its validity. I think it is okay to accept the POSSIBILITY though.
[23:07] <mitchellpraill1234> @Shadakh ya I only chimed in because the one guy said because we cant explain the bing bang it must be god but that makes no sense
[23:07] <thelegendarylurker_> "one reality is certain and indisputable: our own individual reality which is intuitively perceived without the need to any empirical data or substantiation. There can be no doubt that you are a self-conscious reality: a reality that realizes itself!" i didnt write that but i think that pretty well covers what you were saying @Shadakh
[23:07] <eh_polar_bear> is there any way for destiny to start working on HP?
[23:07] <dicedlemming> omg who cares
[23:07] <alexnovalicious> ungeared lvl 30s gets fucked dz

[23:07] <leviathan760> DICEDLEMMING, I don't actually care LUL
[23:08] <shadakh> @PotionCellar, except the spectrum of assumption is huge. you can have tiny assumptions (gravity - constantly substantiated every day of your llife) and massive ones that have no evidence. so you have to see the variance there, and not just say that because someone believes a bee flies, that that means a belief of a teapot orbiting mars is equally likely

[23:08] <lumberinglearner> @Potioncellar This is probably too deep for me, but I agree that we create models of reality to describe our world, these models of reality are assumptions. Even the fact that reality exists is an assumption. But we put forward null hypothesis that are essentially assumptions and try to disprove them. To get a sense of what is actually true and what is not?

[23:10] <potioncellar> @Shadakh, Sure! I'm just trying to say that you have to make assumptions to live life or believe anything. Either, small or large assumption, but assumptions none-the-less. So I don't really think it's illogical to think that a god caused the big bang. It's a theory, it makes sense, the universe is before us now, and there is no better theory at the time.

[23:14] <mom0momo> Why do the american ppl hates the word "socialism"
[23:14] <eh_polar_bear> .... I literally never made the connection until now FailFish
[23:14] <eatoats> your conflating two issues
[23:14] <dicedlemming> MoM0MoMo, because they associate it with communism and were brainwashed from a young age to dislike communism
[23:14] <eh_polar_bear> maybe the word just tastes wrong when they say it
[23:14] <perfectskye> I just ate a chicken casserole that I left out on accident for close to 10 hours. Wish me luck bros.
[23:14] <natescott430> eh_polar_bear, you never noticed the super long arm pointing to dubs and the fact that it's called nathanDubs

[23:14] <eh_polar_bear> NateScott430, it was back at a time when memes didn't matter to me
[23:15] <natescott430> eh_polar_bear, you weren't always a dank memer...?
[23:15] <potioncellar> @Shadakh, There may be a more simple theory, but that doesn't make a more complex theory illogical. Have you read some stuff on Black Holes? That shit is absolutely insane and complex!
[23:15] <eh_polar_bear> NateScott430, no, I was sane once bUrself
[23:15] <kadrek91> @MoM0MoMo, because american people associate socialism with health care, and they want to die poor, exploited, unhealthy and fat LUL
[23:15] <everyonelovesprime> good old times FeelsBadMan
[23:15] <mom0momo> Sooo rude
[23:15] <shadakh> @Lumberinglearner, yeah, thats pretty much the content of what everyones saying here. leave logic to logic and faith to faith. saying faith is logic or logic is faith just muddies the waters
[23:15] <mom0momo> I spoke with an elderly lady today
[23:15] <aapnet> People say Socialism leads to Communism, well guess what Capitalism leads to Fascism LUL
[23:15] <mom0momo> and i asked her why she's voting for Hillary
[23:15] <mom0momo> Guess what was her response?
[23:16] <natescott430> idiotic?
[23:16] <aapnet> she has a vag
[23:16] <lumberinglearner> @Shadakh I agree
[23:16] <thelegendarylurker_> @Kadrek91 lol thats a nice meme sir
[23:16] <konjkave> Because she is going to make Anime real Momo?
[23:16] <dicedlemming> MoM0MoMo, because bernie is too old
[23:16] <akademiker> "she female"
[23:16] <shadakh> @PotionCellar, yes, but a more complex theory is only more logical with more evidence. which isnt there for that particular one at the moment :)
[23:16] <eh_polar_bear> get off my lawn?
[23:16] <everyonelovesprime> fuck socialists nathanDank
[23:16] <purrpul> AAPNet, memes.

[23:17] <konjkave> Did you have sex with her Momo after?
[23:17] <natescott430> MoM0MoMo, SS benefits are a legitimate worry for elderly people, although I'm not familiar with bernie's stance on that.
[23:17] <mom0momo> Eh_polar_bear social security

[23:19] <mom0momo> Press 1 if you're on SB
[23:19] <natescott430> MoM0MoMo, why even talk to elderly people in the first place? And even more, why discuss politics with them? That's just asking for trouble.

[23:19] <lumberinglearner> @potioncellar @shadakh Wouldn't blackholes be illogical to the human brain since we evolved on the savannah plains, kind of interesting that physics has all this simple elegant math, yet it's really complex and illogical to the human brain, especially quantum physics. Where biology is really complex and hard to grasp mathematically yet it's so intuitive to humans. Interesting thought. Forgive the tangent.
[23:20] <potioncellar> @Shadakh, Lol, I guess we will have to disagree on definitions then.
[23:20] <blackswitch900> @MoM0MoMo, You need google ultron
[23:20] <shadakh> @PotionCellar, suppose so.

[23:22] <eh_polar_bear> how much vacation days does Destiny give his mods per year Kappa
[23:22] <potioncellar> I agree! It's important to talk and listen to other's viewpoints. You never know, you may learn something that will change your opinion!
[23:22] <dicedlemming> eh_polar_bear, at the start of each year i fill out a calendar and group them all together around my birthday and christmas and get 2 long breaks

[23:23] <lumberinglearner> @Potioncellar True, but i would need evidence for you to change my opinion
[23:23] <eh_polar_bear> good to know its the same everywhere
[23:23] <shadakh> @Lumberinglearner, yeah its interesting, but i guess we do tend to look out more than in. been to the moon but oceans still unexplored etc. but yea, cool stuff
[23:23] <lumberinglearner> @Potioncellar I'm dragging you back in again :P
[23:23] <iamdreamwing> Thanks to Destiny I found out how big of a scammer Athene is, I was about to donate to them kids to

[23:23] <natescott430> IAmDreamwing, but he seems mostly legit, did you watch all the videos? BrokeBack
[23:23] <mar45690> @potioncellar yes everything is wasist and homophobic 4Head
[23:23] <purrpul> Lumberinglearner, are you immune to rhetoric?
[23:24] <lumberinglearner> @shadakh, when they say that, they mean the ocean floors and caves though. The media likes to spin that as the entire ocean.
[23:24] <iamdreamwing> @NateScott430, The only video I needed to watch was Destiny exposing Athene with Reckful
[23:24] <eh_polar_bear> mods AngelThump
[23:24] <lumberinglearner> @purrpul sorry?
[23:24] <potioncellar> Some things people do and say are racist and homophobic :P @mar45690
[23:24] <lumberinglearner> @purrpul it's late for me, explain in what way?
[23:24] <natescott430> IAmDreamwing, FailFish go watch the video of destiny actually talking to athene and athene asking all the questions well.

[23:25] <shadakh> unless the broken clock is still ticking away :p
[23:25] <iamdreamwing> @NateScott430, Haha okay Athene fan boy, Destiny said all he needed to say and that's that
[23:25] <potioncellar> @Lumberinglearner, Oh, I thought you had something specific you were talking about! Lol, of course you would want evidence.
[23:25] <lumberinglearner> @shadakh Definitely
[23:25] <purrpul> Lumberinglearner, all of your opinions are solely based on evidence? I'm sure people aspire to that, but it's hard for most.
[23:26] <potioncellar> @mar45690, Right :) So sometimes, there are some things that certain people can learn from SJW's :)
[23:26] <dhanik60> whos the fag on the mic
[23:26] <maiayenuhs> fuck all you guys that give credibility to people that spout hatred there's a whole new culture of people that try to explain away people's racism to try and erode what many people in the past that have devoted large portions of their lives to fight against FUCK YOU

[23:27] <eh_polar_bear> love is nothing but the primal urge to find a mate and copulate so as your genetic divergence prevents the offspring from being vulnerable tot he same diseases

[23:27] <lilyachtyyy> @purrpul what time's it for you lol
[23:27] <lumberinglearner> @purrpul I think that you can base what we call love on evidence, whether you should is another story, i personally think you shouldn't. But i guess i'm a hypocrite in that sense.
[23:28] <mar45690> @potioncellar no we can't it's called we can just listen to idk our reasoning instead of morons that pretend "oh the world is so unjust, look at how wasist Witcher 3 is by not putting any black peoples in even though it takes place in FICTIONAL medieval Poland"

[23:32] <purrpul> Lumberinglearner, I haven't got a well thought out response. Interesting question though... I'll have a think. My main point was I would find it impressive if every single opinion or belief you had was based on evidence... maybe that's a strange statement.

[23:34] <purrpul> Lumberinglearner, maybe I need search for more evidence for my opinions/beliefs. Could be projecting a little bit.
[23:34] <eh_polar_bear> I want some momlewds
[23:34] <lumberinglearner> @purrpul I think that's a fair point to make, i also would doubt if i made every decision based on logic, reason and evidence. I would like to think I did, but part of my doubts that.
[23:34] <lilyachtyyy> !momolewds

[23:35] <mindofakid> Destiny, what is the definition of a MILF in your opinion?
[23:35] <mindofakid> @Destiny
[23:35] <purrpul> Lumberinglearner, yeah, I totally agree. It's definitely something to strive for.
[23:36] <lumberinglearner> @purrpul I don't think I have faith though, most of my viewpoints are based on logic and illogic. I strive for evidence perhaps. I'm grasping at straws i feel. To truly know i think you would need to stick me in a giant enclosed experiment. Like the trueman show.
[23:36] <natescott430> !kodiakbearlewds
[23:36] <natescott430> OuO
[23:36] <gawntlet> Lilyachtyyy ive come to learn that people use it as a universal symbol for asian girls, and anime. and subtly reference to anything japanese

[23:40] <gawntlet> Everyone I know liked ing. basterds. I thought it was meh.
[23:40] <mom0momo> anyone else wants lewds?
[23:40] <gawntlet> tarantino needs to be high as fuk when writing movies. not in a normal state of mind 4Head
[23:41] <aapnet> Inglorious Basterds was probably his best film for me PogChamp
[23:41] <nighcol> it was ok but disappointing for a tarantino movie
[23:41] <eh_polar_bear> wow pc games buggy BrokeBack
[23:41] <uzisc> that one scene in the basement of inglorious bastards pretty much sums up hateful 8

[23:42] <eh_polar_bear> Response
[23:42] <eh_polar_bear> Hello
[23:42] <mom0momo> That doesnt make any sense
[23:42] <gawntlet> Brother Mouzoun was epic.
[23:43] <aapnet> @NateScott430, the TriHard worked for the Jew lady in the theater and they plotted to kill Hitler
[23:43] <mom0momo> Guys
[23:43] <eh_polar_bear> the MEME streets of Omaha?
[23:43] <mindofakid> A lot of decisions people make don't make sense. Why start smoking meth when you are too poor to consistently afford it?
[23:43] <mom0momo> Know your Politcal Media http://i.imgur.com/KzFrs2J.jpg
[23:43] <blackswitch900> @AAPNet, she was def not jew i dont think
[23:43] <uzisc> because meth is poppi
[23:43] <mom0momo> How accurate this that chart?
[23:43] <eh_polar_bear> are there black jewish people?
[23:44] <curtsy> Meth heads steal a lot of fucking shit to pay their habit man
[23:44] <mindofakid> HAHAHAHAHAHA
[23:44] <eh_polar_bear> is that a scientifical possibility
[23:44] <flaza54> meth helps them to forget that they're broke
[23:44] <purrpul> > BBC > Bipartisan LUL
[23:44] <uzisc> blackswitch900 the whole point of the movie is that shes a jew... the beginning of the movie where the kids are under the floorboards

[23:44] <aapnet> @blackswitch900, She was a Jew, she was the lady who escaped from the slaughter in the beginning of the movie in France
[23:44] <wreckoon> usa is an extraordinary phenomenon .. poor people are willingly accepting the dick to see rich people getting richer and richer
[23:45] <blackswitch900> okiiie
[23:45] <mom0momo> How come The Colbert report isnt on there
[23:45] <mom0momo> or the Daily show?

[23:46] <kadrek91> Did Destiny ever talk about Israel?
[23:46] <eh_polar_bear> spam bots get no mercy

[23:46] <aapnet> BuzzFeed is bipartisan 4Head
[23:46] <natescott430> Perfectskye, It's a spambot, it gets instadeleted and not even bttv can see it
[23:46] <perfectskye> oh a link.
[23:46] <aapnet> BuzzFeed is SJW cuck
[23:47] <mom0momo> Guys
[23:47] <perfectskye> Gotcha.
[23:47] <mom0momo> I did some research
[23:47] <wreckoon> @Purrpul, not what i mean at all .. i feel the americans have way too much admiration for rich people
[23:47] <gawntlet> Potioncellar do you brownies? do you have icecream? microwave brownies for like 20-25 sec. eat them with icecream
[23:47] <eh_polar_bear> BuzzFeed is retarded
[23:47] <mom0momo> By research
[23:47] <natescott430> watcha got momo?
[23:47] <mom0momo> I mean i just googled it
[23:47] <potioncellar> No brownies, and I think I have a Snickers Icecream bar @Gawntlet
[23:47] <snufflesyay> how good is this game
[23:47] <eh_polar_bear> that is the only research that matters
[23:47] <mom0momo> How come Hillary's Youtube channel is filled with dislikes
[23:47] <natescott430> LUL
[23:47] <konjkave> Oh you found some new lewds Mom0?
[23:47] <eh_polar_bear> because she's a cuck
[23:47] <mindofakid> Because she felt the Bern
[23:47] <aapnet> @MoM0MoMo, really? Keepo
[23:47] <perfectskye> People that use most internet platforms don't like her lying.
[23:47] <mom0momo> Aapnet yeah
[23:47] <mom0momo> go to her youtube channel
[23:48] <mom0momo> most of her vids have like 1/2 dislikes
[23:48] <snufflesyay> studies have shown that bernie performs better in states with larger internet usage
[23:48] <konjkave> That is because the internet is biased.
[23:48] <purrpul> wreckoon, I agree, but that's pretty subjective. People desire different things, are fulfilled in different ways. Who are we to tell them what to value or admire?
[23:48] <mrmtndew222> lol
[23:48] <dildofire_> hillary is a criminal
[23:48] <konjkave> Hillary is a criminal, AND A CUCK. How could anyone vote for her?
[23:49] <natescott430> !momolewds OuO
[23:49] <destiny_bot> Destiny updates YouTube regularly now! "DayZ - The Return of the King" posted 8h 49m ago youtu.be/UBVoAA9nvoM

[23:49] <pearninja> OuO
[23:50] <konjkave> @Zaskaszh nice middle eastern memes
[23:50] <perfectskye> It's a pretty paid advertisement. A lot of young individuals don't enjoy the message and how it's portrayed.
[23:50] <mom0momo> Guys
[23:50] <gawntlet> Mom0momo it could be because it seems kinda fake and scripted. no?

[23:57] <aapnet> @NateScott430, who cares about the Communist Chinese population EleGiggle
[23:57] <engineer_bob> Anyways. Wonder what happens when Rubio drops out. Do most of his supporters got to Cruz
[23:57] <shadakh> It's a rude word in bsg, and I will tell u what it means when u r older momo
[23:58] <zaskaszh> China now knows how to breed bulletproof hamsters.
[23:58] <aapnet> Yes most rubio supporters are apart of the anti-trump GOP
[23:58] <wreckoon> fracking is some process involving oil or smth. .. it's a very efficient method that creates the most amount of pollution or smth
[23:58] <defreshed> 6x125 + 6x3
[23:58] <wreckoon> don't take my word for it
[23:58] <engineer_bob> If Kasich/Rubio voters go to Cruz. Trump is in trouble.
[23:58] <perfectskye> 6x100 + 6x28 is easier, no?
[23:59] <natescott430> Gawntlet, I LOVED Mad Max in 3d, though. That was one movie that I can say the 3d improved the experience or at least didn't lower it.

[00:08] <mom0momo> Cannot GET /7068657http://strawpoll.me/7068590
[00:08] <iamdreamwing> Trump will take care of all the immigrants taking our jobs
[00:08] <engineer_bob> And I don't think he's pulling over enough Independents/Dems.
[00:09] <zaskaszh> Fonald Trump's fingers are so small he pays someone to pick his nose for him.

[00:09] <gawntlet> CS- ResidentSleeper
[00:09] <perfectskye> Cuz SVU is the only show.
[00:09] <engineer_bob> This election does rock this year though. Best I've been apart of.

[00:09] <curtsy> I think he means svu
[00:10] <azerkex> those motherfuckers leveled up

[00:10] <aapnet> @Kadrek91, true
[00:10] <akademiker> I just leveled up bUrself
[00:10] <saviorself44> theres like 5 CSI spinoffs now or some shit and they are terribad
[00:10] <mrmtndew222> I want Trump to be trolling so fucking hard and when elections are near done he would reveal to believe nothing what he said, that would be hilarious
[00:10] <codan1990> destiny that hacking thing was ncis
[00:10] <brock4ever> the xfiles had a really great gamer episode - ever see the one where they go inside a virtual reality game? That was memes
[00:10] <perfectskye> Yeah SVU is the ultimate. Glad you meant it.
[00:10] <codan1990> the double hacking thing was ncis
[00:10] <kadrek91> yeah law and order SeemsGood
[00:10] <zaskaszh> Donald Trump's fingers are so small his 2" dick looks yuuuuuuge by comparison.
[00:10] <gawntlet> Mrmtndew222 ikr. please
[00:10] <akademiker> ncis is the only good csi
[00:10] <yulie355> Cop procedural shows are always trash thouhg
[00:10] <saviorself44> Law and Order: Criminal Intent, thats some good shit
[00:11] <codan1990> law and order svu is intense. literally only rape crimes
[00:11] <babydrool> >hackers in Miami. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Gonzalez
[00:11] <konjkave> Don't forget the GUI scene, and the fucking DOUBLE ENHANCE scene in Doctor Who
[00:11] <babydrool> I love Cuba
[00:11] <nikrado> ncis la is actually super intense but the original only started being good after like 5 seasons
[00:11] <thelegendarylurker_> @Zaskaszh you mean his 2" dick looks "tremendous"
[00:11] <akademiker> so destiny enjoys watching rape?
[00:11] <mom0momo> Hey Guys

[00:12] <features_> For being set in new york i have yet to see players off the ground or even on the second floor of any of these sky rises
[00:12] <engineer_bob> I like the cop show Blue Bloods.
[00:12] <engineer_bob> And Rookie Blue I think it's called?
[00:12] <uroasonany> what is she takes in a hand? wbt.link/qVM8m
[00:12] <destiny_bot> 7 days for prohibited phrase
[00:13] <konjkave> Also forgot about the prince of persia episode and the other one with the fucking mmo bullshit lol.
[00:13] <aapnet> @Engineer_Bob, yeah those are the shows
[00:13] <iamdreamwing> Hilary Clinton will be the best president
[00:13] <akademiker> FeelsBadMan no more fresh prince of bel aire, cuz will smith joined scientology
[00:13] <engineer_bob> Well, with her you got 2 presidents for the price of one. Though it seems Bill is different from what he was in the 90s, maybe not though.
[00:14] <pearninja> it was fine in BB
[00:14] <purrpul> akademiker, I just ordered an Austrian IMCO lighter. Much better than plebby American Zippos. Kappa
[00:14] <kadrek91> Destiny doesnt get the Dark Souls lore FeelsBadMan
[00:14] <zaskaszh> I wish they made a shooter that accurately simulated being able to shoot a guy in the scrote so his 'nads fell out and dangled like fuzzy dice. And you could stomp on 'em.
[00:14] <features_> Hilary Clinton will be too aware shes the first female president and desperate to prove shes not soft..... becoming an absolute cunt pirate like thatcher
[00:14] <engineer_bob> Don't quote me but I thought Will Smith left scientology.
[00:14] <itsmurda> who is ready for a rubio presidency 4Head
[00:14] <akademiker> @purrpul fire up the ovens with it Kappa
[00:14] <konjkave> I think it would make more sense if the pvp was reversed in Dark Souls, if you spend souls and regain humanity you shouldn't be invaded
[00:14] <natescott430> Engineer_Bob, though I guess you could argue that with china's massive population, they could steal our tech/trade secrets then grow them exponentially since they have more people which means more scientists/engineers.
[00:14] <purrpul> akademiker, LUL
[00:14] <itsmurda> isnt the penalty for leaving scientology death?
[00:14] <konjkave> Otherwise you are fucked
[00:15] <trenchlord> Destiny I'm already level 30/51 dark zone
[00:15] <eh_polar_bear> iTsMurda, no, worse. Lawyers
[00:15] <engineer_bob> @NateScott430, Yeah, there's also India.
[00:15] <itsmurda> oh god
[00:15] <nikrado> more people doesnt mean smarter people
[00:15] <zaskaszh> The penalty for leaving Arby's is death.
[00:15] <lavanox> ECK
[00:15] <purrpul> features_, muh coal mines. muh unions.
[00:15] <louder_howard> Itsmurda sometimes, sometimes just constant harassment
[00:15] <eh_polar_bear> 4ggEch
[00:16] <toxicherpes> why does destiny's twitch chat is always slow as fuck
[00:16] <xgromitx> To be honest only ppl who have at least a high school diploma should be able to vote
[00:16] <nikrado> @ToxicHerpes, cause the chat he reads and the more popular chat is on his website
[00:16] <akademiker> chat, name me one successful german
[00:16] <engineer_bob> Not a lot of trolls here Toxic.
[00:16] <konjkave> Well then the election is bias Grom
[00:16] <lavanox> ToxicHerpes cause everyone is chatting on his website
[00:16] <curtsy> @ToxicHerpes, The bulk of the actual chatters are on his website
[00:16] <natescott430> Nikrado, he reads this one too FeelsBadMan
[00:16] <engineer_bob> And that yeah.

[00:17] <natescott430> Engineer_Bob, does India have a history of steailng tech/hacking into U.S. departments like china? And I'd think massive overpopulation would fuck them long before they fuck us DuckerZ
[00:17] <xgromitx> At least Momo is gone his memes aint even fun

[00:25] <stopthehype> Politics are for sheep and the poor
[00:25] <engineer_bob> Meh. I can see the draw to Trump as an Independent or a Liberal.
[00:25] <engineer_bob> But you can't vote for someone where he only maybe draws you on 1 or 2 views compared to the ones you don't like.

[00:55] <dizzydazz33> hi
[00:55] <dizzydazz33> how are ya
[00:55] <engineer_bob> Neither Trump nor Sanders support any of the violent protesters. I don't get it either.
[00:55] <syphonite> man your first daily mission on challenging difficulty is gonna fuck your shit in so hard i'm gonna start calling you Randy Marsh
[00:56] <aapnet> @Target2, damn I like Bernie, but that was insanely hypocritical
[00:56] <target2> he says Donald Trump needs to tell his supporters to stop inciting violence while at the same time says he can't be responsible for all acts of violence from his own supporters
[00:56] <winningsomegames> Trump encourages violence sanders dosent
[00:57] <engineer_bob> Sanders supporter myself but what happened in Chicago was pretty fucked up for people to do.
[00:57] <winningsomegames> How is that hypocritical
[00:57] <target2> did you even watch the fucking video I linked?
[00:57] <lemmiiwinks> I'm getting a little bit of panicBasket
[00:57] <winningsomegames> Yep
[00:57] <winningsomegames> I did
[00:57] <wreckoon> you have to realize that retards are everywhere, it doesn't matter what they support
[00:57] <gawntlet> smooth here
[00:57] <aapnet> @Winningsomegames, yes but Trump never says directy he supports violence FailFish
[00:57] <engineer_bob> How is Sanders responsible for people that support him causing stupid shit to happen.
[00:57] <winningsomegames> @aapnet never demotes it either
[00:57] <engineer_bob> Same for Trump really. Even though he says some stuff from time to time about protesters at his rallies.
[00:58] <aapnet> @Winningsomegames, bernie didnt demote it when they asked him
[00:58] <th3g0df4th3r123123> I take Target2 is a trump supporter
[00:58] <engineer_bob> All you can do is condone it. Sanders and Trump both blame each other which is dumb.
[00:58] <winningsomegames> @aapnet yes he did LMAO
[00:58] <bobdole0> i heard someone say they don't like sanders because he doesn't like sanders supporters
[00:58] <eclips4x> @AAPNet, he encourages violence there's no doubt. His rhetoric is very offensive to a lot of people, you can't doubt that and he even jokes about shooting people down in the streets and still not lose supporters
[00:58] <lemmiiwinks> Retards NotLikeThis
[00:59] <aapnet> @Winningsomegames, oh misheard I thought the person asked if he denounced the violent protesters not if he was responsible
[00:59] <gawntlet> THe sooner you stop talking to Trump supporters, and ingore them in chat, the sooner your IQ will stop dropping 4Head
[00:59] <bobdole0> sry i mean *he doesn't like sanders because sander's supporters

[01:00] <natescott430> you hear that, dicedlemming? Destiny needs to tear apart all these shit mods. NATESCOTT430 2016

[01:01] <mom0momo> Why arent you guys celebrating White Day?
[01:01] <staxzilla> you don't need congress to be a memer
[01:01] <bobdole0> i think the scariest thing about trump being president is that every other country will hate america
[01:01] <mom0momo> Bobdole0 they already do
[01:01] <itsmurda> the 2020 pres will be more danker than the 2016 and the 2024 pres will be more danker than 2020
[01:01] <lemmiiwinks> Who cares about any other day besdies pi day ConcernDoge
[01:01] <aapnet> Well Trump is already a meme even though he is only running for president so far
[01:01] <leviathan760> it's still 3/13 over here
[01:01] <gawntlet> is it really pi day? I was randomly watchng a video on how Pi was discovered. Spooky.
[01:01] <slayer2495> @Bobdole0, you mean they dont already?
[01:01] <bobdole0> doesn't mean it can't be worse
[01:01] <mom0momo> What difference would it make?

[01:03] <brock4ever> +3
[01:03] <engineer_bob> I may eat my words in November but I don't see Rubio/Kasich voters getting behind Trump.
[01:03] <gtyroldafatty> the cloud in the background PogChamp
[01:03] <natescott430> MoM0MoMo, #2
[01:03] <engineer_bob> Hell everyone who supported Carson won't back him I bet.
[01:03] <staxzilla> 3rd
[01:03] <winningsomegames> I see Bernie supporters getting behind trump
[01:03] <engineer_bob> They say they will but I don't know.
[01:03] <winningsomegames> I don't see republicans voting for Hilary
[01:03] <itsmurda> does bernie have a chance
[01:03] <engineer_bob> He needs to win Ohio and/or Florida.
[01:03] <itsmurda> everyone seems to be writing bernie off already
[01:03] <engineer_bob> And Illinois for sure otherwise nope.
[01:04] <mom0momo> Itsmurda Correction
[01:04] <mom0momo> it's the Media writing Bernie Off
[01:04] <winningsomegames> I mean, I guess he has a chance, but it's probs like 5 percent
[01:04] <aapnet> This election is more of an establishment vs anti establishment than Republican vs Democrat
[01:04] <itsmurda> true
[01:04] <aapnet> and some more anti hillary and anti trump
[01:04] <gawntlet> Itsmurda i think its over for him. His job was really to raise issues that hillary otherwise may have not been compelled to talk about. he did his job. He'll back her within a month imo
[01:04] <mom0momo> Guys
[01:04] <kinglly> (Serious) Why does Bernie have such a bad chance at winning? i thought he was winning/doing really well?
[01:04] <lemmiiwinks> panicBasket
[01:05] <itsmurda> i really don't see him backing her @Gawntlet
[01:05] <engineer_bob> If Sanders does back Clinton though; do you think all the Sanders voters will just jump to Trump? Hmm.
[01:05] <mom0momo> Isn't it Ironic that Bernie Sanders, Who is the oldest candidate using social media to win the youths
[01:05] <mom0momo> Rather than Hillary
[01:05] <gawntlet> Itsmurda ?? oh he def will. theyre so friendly :D
[01:05] <itsmurda> anyone here have any reasons they dont like rubio
[01:05] <mrdjlaw> cux?
[01:05] <jayyy_> are we getting cuxed right now? or is it just me?
[01:05] <itsmurda> yes cux is real
[01:05] <winningsomegames> @kinglly ? He's doing better than expected but not well
[01:05] <mom0momo> CUX
[01:05] <staxzilla> ehh i wouldn't say its ironic
[01:05] <natescott430> cux
[01:05] <duckduck60053> the cuxening
[01:05] <engineer_bob> I'm glad I have Tuesday off from work and don't have to go in til evening Wednesday. Tomorrow is going to be so rage inducing.
[01:05] <staxzilla> remember when ron paul was giving the youth a boner back in 2012
[01:06] <itsmurda> anyone here live in ontario
[01:06] <staxzilla> and he was old as fuck too
[01:06] <mom0momo> Bernie Sanders appeals more to younger voters
[01:06] <mom0momo> Hillary appeals more to older ones
[01:06] <natescott430> iTsMurda, I don't like rubio because he still holds the idiotic belief that climate change isn't real.
[01:06] <winningsomegames> Does she really tho
[01:06] <mom0momo> Natescott430 i think he knows its real
[01:06] <engineer_bob> I cringed when they asked him that question and he had that response Nate lol at the debate.
[01:06] <itsmurda> hes said it is real but theres nothing we can do about it @NateScott430
[01:06] <mom0momo> Lets dispell the myth that rubio doesn't know what he's doing
[01:06] <winningsomegames> I feel like older people are heavily republican
[01:07] <mom0momo> He knows exactly what he's doing
[01:07] <engineer_bob> I mean he does have a point in a way but doesn't mean he shouldn't push for green energy.
[01:07] <jeantubinville> rubio has my vote
[01:07] <winningsomegames> This cox LUL
[01:07] <wreckoon> denying climate change is a must if you wanna get ito the republican party
[01:07] <itsmurda> how long til the republican party dies out?
[01:07] <engineer_bob> Which he won't do cause of oil/coal country.
[01:07] <mrdjlaw> game completed, next game
[01:07] <itsmurda> destiny said 20 years i think
[01:07] <itsmurda> i think its much closer to 10
[01:08] <natescott430> iTsMurda, MoM0MoMo, Okay, then I must be misremembering his statement.
[01:08] <engineer_bob> Upgrading all to 100% is beneficial.
[01:08] <winningsomegames> If they survive this election they might recover
[01:08] <natescott430> Rubio responded: "Well, sure, the climate is changing, and one of the reasons why the climate is changing is the climate has always been changing," he said, interrupted by applause. "There's never been a time when the climate has not changed. I think the fundamental question for a policymaker is, is the climate changing because of something we are doing, and if so, is there a law you can pass to fix it?"
[01:08] <winningsomegames> Maybe
[01:08] <natescott430> holy long text
[01:09] <itsmurda> ok yeah thats pretty retarded
[01:09] <engineer_bob> Maybe if they have a brokered convention they'd pit Nikki Haley against Hillary.
[01:09] <destiny_bot> Destiny updates YouTube regularly now! "DayZ - The Return of the King" posted 10h 9m ago youtu.be/UBVoAA9nvoM
[01:09] <winningsomegames> @natescott430 look up California law changes regarding the climate change, it helped Cali so much
[01:09] <gawntlet> Itsmurda rep. party will have to reevaluate themselves after (if) they lose this election :) just like Cons party is doing here in Canada. time to broaden the appeal. younger generation is diff and really attracted to liberal politics
[01:09] <winningsomegames> @natescott430 that is 100 percent bs
[01:09] <natescott430> iTsMurda, MoM0MoMo, I saw a clip of rubio that only showed the part where he said the very first part which is as stupid as bringing a snowball to senate to disprove it. I didn't see the full quote.
[01:10] <gawntlet> especially since demographics are getting broaded and theres no stopping it Itsgubby
[01:10] <itsmurda> i agree in canada even the conservatives are fairly liberal @Gawntlet
[01:10] <lawke> Destiny you can do the daily missions right now. the timer only means thats when they reset to new ones
[01:10] <gawntlet> Itsmurda *
[01:10] <mom0momo> Name something in the world that is a "myth"
[01:10] <mom0momo> Ill start, Climate Change
[01:10] <winningsomegames> Oh wait gay marriage isn't legal in Mexico right
[01:10] <mom0momo> Kappa
[01:10] <maiayenuhs> republican party didn't reevaluate themselves after palin or Romney or the Tea party why would they do it after Trump?
[01:10] <gawntlet> Itsmurda ya i liked Harper a lot from 2006-2012ish. I feel later in his career, he got some bad advisors
[01:10] <winningsomegames> Is it?
[01:11] <natescott430> MoM0MoMo, my heart skipped a beat when I was waiting for you to Kappa
[01:11] <maiayenuhs> they are in control of the house and have the senate deadlocked
[01:11] <itsmurda> did you hear about free tuition for familes that make 50k and under @Gawntlet Kreygasm
[01:11] <staxzilla> @Mom0momo Religion
[01:11] <gawntlet> Maiayenuhs yea... we'll see haha
[01:11] <gawntlet> Itsmurda oh really. i'll read about that OMGScoots
[01:11] <engineer_bob> A lot of colleges provide pretty big scholarships for those that don't make much money though.
[01:12] <winningsomegames> Hey where is that @aapnet dude who asked me about Christian countries withou gay marriage
[01:12] <mom0momo> If public Tution is free
[01:12] <winningsomegames> How did I not think of Mexico
[01:12] <mom0momo> what give professors the incentive to teach better?
[01:12] <winningsomegames> Or South America
[01:12] <engineer_bob> Not that I'm saying free college isn't a bad idea. But a lot offer a lot of financial aid.
[01:12] <winningsomegames> At all
[01:12] <curtsy> Mexico has gay marriage
[01:12] <curtsy> Google it
[01:12] <winningsomegames> In two states
[01:12] <gtyroldafatty> mexico DansGame
[01:12] <winningsomegames> Out of 31
[01:12] <curtsy> It still has it
[01:13] <engineer_bob> I've been wondering that too Momo
[01:13] <gawntlet> the interest rate in Canada forpaying back loans is 7%
[01:13] <tehillusiveman> free tuition is so worthless, so many people are just gonna drop out 1st or major in something useless
[01:13] <gawntlet> student loans*
[01:13] <tehillusiveman> 1st year*
[01:13] <gawntlet> around 7% last time i checed
[01:13] <engineer_bob> Public Education is already in the drain because of funding issues. Would the same happen to public colleges?
[01:13] <engineer_bob> How do they make money.
[01:13] <winningsomegames> In all but two of Mexico's 31 states, gay marriage is still banned under local laws. Mexico City, which is not a state, became the first capital in Latin America to allow same-sex unions in 2009. Only the states of Coahuila and Quintana Roo have followed suit.Jul 1, 2015
[01:13] <winningsomegames> This is what I got
[01:13] <winningsomegames> When I googled it
[01:14] <gtyroldafatty> actually mexico city recently became a state
[01:14] <winningsomegames> Well
[01:14] <winningsomegames> Shit
[01:14] <oldirtywhiteman> Origin and Uplay are beating us everywhere GabeN
[01:14] <mom0momo> agree
[01:14] <winningsomegames> >up lay
[01:14] <gawntlet> Mom0momo after careful analysis, i pick #1 from my right
[01:14] <mom0momo> wont free education just make students much lazier?
[01:14] <mom0momo> keep going to school and never graduate>
[01:15] <engineer_bob> not if there's conditions
[01:15] <winningsomegames> @mom0momo how the fuck does that work
[01:15] <natescott430> Gawntlet, "careful analysis" FapFapFap DansGame
[01:15] <oldirtywhiteman> it was just a meme bro
[01:15] <gawntlet> 4Head im sure theres a limit to like 4 -5 years Mom0momo
[01:15] <tehillusiveman> imo free tuition should only be for 2nd or 3rd year and beyond
[01:16] <karlcastillo> lol
[01:16] <winningsomegames> @mom0momo yeah if you want to work at McDonald's for the rest of your life cause your unmotivated then you won't go to college in the first place
[01:16] <winningsomegames> That's what I'm doing
[01:16] <natescott430> TehIllusiveMan, that could make sense. If you prove that you are committed, you get the help to finish it.
[01:16] <brock4ever> free tuition only to those who make the dankest of memes
[01:16] <gawntlet> ^
[01:16] <natescott430> Maybe another way could be to offer tax incentives for college graduates to offset the loans/interest.
[01:16] <mom0momo> Name a college degree that is useless in today's society

[01:17] <engineer_bob> Free tuition will have conditions that will have to be met. I doubt it'll be free for everyone. Just only for those that work for it.
[01:17] <curtsy> My province actually got rid of the high school diploma because too many kids were dropping out. Now you get a work permit regardless of pass or fail.

[01:17] <engineer_bob> @NateScott430, that'd definitely be awesome. There is a tax credit already for people that go to college; two of them I think atm.
[01:17] <mom0momo> name something America isn't good at anymore

[01:30] <engineer_bob> that class would've been better on Wednesday morning
[01:31] <potioncellar> @GTyRoLDaFaTtY, I think we have our next paper assignment lecture, though... FeelsBadMan
[01:31] <zongopbongo> NateScott430 are you implying you are actually pacjax's other account?
[01:32] <winningsomegames> Do you get to kill religious people in this game
[01:32] <engineer_bob> lol
[01:32] <natescott430> zongopbongo, implying, denying, confirming, all these 'ings. Let's get down to facts, not gerunds.
[01:32] <natescott430> Kappa
[01:32] <regfox> it's a tom clancy game, you can only kill brown terrorists
[01:32] <regfox> ayyy
[01:33] <zongopbongo> NateScott430 nevermind you're not pacjax, that retard doesnt know half those words
[01:33] <zongopbongo> NateScott430 good bait had my attention for a little bit
[01:33] <yura37> what kind of terrorists are there other than brown ones DansGame Keepo
[01:33] <natescott430> zongopbongo, FeelsGoodMan
[01:33] <engineer_bob> Nothing.
[01:33] <mudge54> why does destiny use autism chat on his website
[01:34] <lizardwrath> let me guess leveling past 30 is dlc?
[01:34] <obtaining> is this game any fun?it looks over hypedlike how destiny and titanfall werelooks like it'll get boring after a few days to a few weeks
[01:34] <natescott430> Mudge54, it ruins everything if left uncontained.
[01:34] <mudge54> ppshhphhpgh
[01:34] <yura37> it looks like it would be fun with friends
[01:35] <yura37> like borderlandsish
[01:35] <reekteek> How many games exist that don't get boring after playing them for weeks
[01:35] <zongopbongo> Obtaining with friends at the same level i imagine its fun for a while. its very grindy though
[01:35] <lizardwrath> csgo
[01:35] <gawntlet> PogChamp this is being shown in korea as the final BvS trailer PogChamp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ez_TA97jyGM sfw
[01:35] <lizardwrath> that's all i got
[01:35] <engineer_bob> lot of RNG and Min/Maxing to do with Darkzone; hell summit had a 30 hour stream doing it today
[01:35] <curtsy> The game has no endgame yet, dlc is coming soon.
[01:35] <zongopbongo> ReekTeek legal of legends Keepo
[01:35] <engineer_bob> this game would keep you busy doing that
[01:35] <yura37> dota 2
[01:36] <obtaining> Only TPS games that I've like have been: Gears of War (series) - Syphon Filter (you guys dont know about that) and metal gear solid
[01:36] <engineer_bob> Syphon Filter was the shit.
[01:36] <obtaining> Games like Halo and Call of duty never get boring Kappa
[01:36] <ionone> operation spec obs
[01:37] <ionone> what
[01:37] <natescott430> Obtaining, syphon filter was awesome. my brother and I spent hundreds of hours with that multiplayer
[01:37] <lizardwrath> germans are efficient
[01:37] <aftermathmike> @Destiny, its for the semi trucks
[01:37] <smugsub_elnubnub> @Destiny Probably as a LOOK BOTH WAYS type of warning?
[01:37] <luxredux> Hey chat, has Destiny ever commented on George Soros and his disruptive involvement in Western politics?
[01:37] <lizardwrath> gotta save that 1s on your commute
[01:37] <smugsub_elnubnub> warning/reminder
[01:37] <zongopbongo> destiny you fucking retard, obviously its to have a wider variety of colours for people to enjoy Keepo
[01:37] <dudetheman2> or for city busses to go first
[01:37] <ionone> yellow = get ready to break
[01:37] <dudetheman2> I've seen that
[01:38] <gawntlet> thats a bad idea Destiny. Because I always associate yellow as a warning to make a decision to stop the car or not
[01:38] <engineer_bob> yellow means go faster
[01:38] <reexa1> yellow fakes me out all the fucking time
[01:38] <engineer_bob> Red light cameras all over the place where I live so yellow means slam on your brakes.
[01:38] <spy4hire> Might be to let everyone who has standards let the clutch out
[01:38] <argacha> @Destiny Easier to code bro
[01:38] <thundaaz> I'm german and it's not true ... they turn from red to green
[01:39] <dudetheman2> there are more manual transmission cars there, they take a second longer to get ready maybe
[01:39] <gawntlet> oh
[01:39] <destiny_bot> Remember to use Destiny's Amazon referral link! destiny.gg/amazon
[01:40] <natescott430> Engineer_Bob, my city had red light cameras on every intersection until the local asian community banded together and protested at city hall to remove them DuckerZ
[01:41] <engineer_bob> Asians #1
[01:41] <dudetheman2> there are actually studies that show that red light cameras cause more traffic accidents. they are there for the sole purpose of making the city money
[01:42] <natescott430> It's really fucking scary sometimes. I have to wait at least 2 seconds after my light turns green because there will ALWAYS be 3+ cars that are running the red.
[01:44] <engineer_bob> lol
[01:44] <cizincho> :D
[01:45] <engineer_bob> dont say that, people will believe that
[01:45] <retrolurker> water temple was just annoying
[01:45] <staxzilla> if pokemon has taught me anything its that fire>ice
[01:45] <konjkave> I had friends that restarted their save file because they thought they got stuck in the water temple

[01:51] <ig_zodiac> The whole chat would spam the "lets build a wall" chat meme
[01:51] <mom0momo> If Trump were to stream on Twitch
[01:51] <mom0momo> What game woul he be playing?
[01:51] <staxzilla> hearthstone
[01:51] <engineer_bob> he'd be playing Papers Please

[01:58] <dizaster0> yea its guaranteed golds not purples it will be raining in purps in dz
[01:58] <dizaster0> @Destiny,
[01:58] <tujev> destiny the cuck
[01:58] <jlpc0bra> is there ever a moment in this stream where steven isn't listening or talking about politics
[01:58] <kotourachan> was trump condoning the violence?
[01:58] <sporkbomb> destiny grew up!
[01:58] <sporkbomb> *wipes tear*
[01:59] <gawntlet> The way trump reacts to protestors who disturb the rally is autistic. childish
[01:59] <engineer_bob> it's why a lot of people watch his stream is for his opinions on a lot of hot topics tbh
[01:59] <maiayenuhs> loldamar should be sterilized if he wants to continue to shitpost in chat
[01:59] <engineer_bob> Wish we had a Destiny Newshour or something.
[01:59] <konjkave> This is shit that happened in Rome =/
[01:59] <destiny_bot> Destiny has a new Twitter! twitter.com/OmniDestiny
[01:59] <gawntlet> whats even nore NotLikeThis is that his supporters would counter destiny by saying "He tells it like it is" Meme

[01:59] <gawntlet> MVGame
[01:59] <whiteguycash> lmfao, is this real? Is this really Destiny now?
[02:00] <ironchieftain> ^ lol wtf?
[02:00] <tujev> defends the sjw that came to crash the rally and supress peoples right to assemble the cuckening is real
[02:00] <haardtek> Hello guys, I'm back from my 600 seconds timeout. During that time I was able to finish my 200 words essay on the topic of Nazi Germany. My thesis is that Hitler & Nazi beliefs are carried on by twitch tv Nazi moderators who like to act as if they themselves were literally Hitler. I think I should score at least 90 out of 100 points for that paper.
[02:00] <maiayenuhs> Trump told a black guy to get a job when he was being taken out of the rally by police why not just call him a lazy *** why beat around the bush
[02:00] <xenohart238> i like destiny poltics tho
[02:00] <mom0momo> Who would win in a fist fight? Hillary or Donald Trump?
[02:00] <flaveless> trump would pay someone to fight for him
[02:01] <ig_zodiac> but so would hillary
[02:01] <ig_zodiac> so who would they both pick to fight for them?
[02:01] <mom0momo> But Hillary would pay someone to fight for her
[02:01] <gawntlet> Maiayenuhs yea I make that makes NO sense hey? sure you can get angry when people disturb your rallies repeatedly but theres a way to respond to this. Why would he say that LUL
[02:01] <mom0momo> ie. her Husband
[02:01] <mom0momo> Kappa
[02:01] <gawntlet> i mean* Maiayenuhs
[02:01] <omniscientblue> Saying the audience can defend themselves is different then calling out FOR attendants to pursue violence
[02:01] <whiteguycash> I wonder if destiny would be willing to sit down with Anita Sarkeesian for Coffee now and discuss the finer points of how The Division does a good job of not sexualizing female characters?
[02:01] <liquidfire92> Momo idk he did well vs Vince Kapp https://imgur.com/Om5iMTt
[02:01] <liquidfire92> * Kappa
[02:01] <kotourachan> can we just forgo all these politics and just have candidates fight to the death, at least then we'd be entertained
[02:02] <pearninja> MrDestructoid
[02:02] <nintendojitsu> Did he fight the chopper already?
[02:02] <maiayenuhs> that composition makes no sense when I read it can you rewrite it please
[02:02] <luisftwxd> Liquidfire92, LUL
[02:02] <engineer_bob> Why would you as a protester go to a private venue that a rally is and expect to protest and be safe anyways.
[02:02] <ig_zodiac> deathmatch: only kind of politics i support
[02:02] <mom0momo> Liquidfire92 quite the memes
[02:02] <marmelaid> clinton.. then G W bush.. i guess Trump is the next step in this madness.

[02:18] <dizaster0> @destiny security steady hands
[02:18] <engineer_bob> Clinton will be in deep shit.
[02:18] <natescott430> I am absolutley APPALLED that an honorable moderator for a respected streamer's twitch channel would advocate a heinous act such as assassination!
[02:18] <natescott430> NOBULLY
[02:18] <engineer_bob> Then it comes down to NY and Cali.
[02:19] <engineer_bob> I guess PA.
[02:19] <nintendojitsu> she has a 200= DELEGATE LEAD OVER HIM

[02:19] <jingsly> Hello memers
[02:19] <natescott430> HeyGuys
[02:19] <liquidfire92> HeyGuys
[02:19] <engineer_bob> Yeah he'd have to win with big margins for sure. Wednesday is going to be crazy.
[02:20] <natescott430> Liquidfire92, PogChamp
[02:20] <engineer_bob> I feel like some sub reddits will be on suicide watch.
[02:20] <nintendojitsu> lol
[02:20] <nintendojitsu> 4chan too
[02:20] <jingsly> What's on wed
[02:20] <natescott430> I thought pol hated the bernmeister
[02:21] <nintendojitsu> there are a few who like him. A few
[02:21] <engineer_bob> The first day of reality people wake up to after Tuesday's results.
[02:22] <nintendojitsu> Tuesday is literally do or die for Bernie
[02:22] <wreckoon> i dont understand, i thought he was doing well
[02:22] <nintendojitsu> ...
[02:22] <engineer_bob> He is 200 behind which he can make up by winning big margins.
[02:22] <liquidfire92> every tuesday is a do or die for Bernie FeelsBadMan
[02:22] <gawntlet> weow
[02:22] <engineer_bob> But if he loses some really big states on Tuesday....
[02:23] <engineer_bob> That math won't let him win.
[02:23] <gawntlet> yea next week is exciting dudes
[02:23] <jingsly> Feelsbadman for u guys if trump wins
[02:23] <moondoggie01> Destiny pls it was me m8 NoTears
[02:23] <xenohart238> Lincoln tunnel is the easiest Challenge mode
[02:23] <engineer_bob> I don't see him winning personally but meh. We'll see.
[02:24] <nintendojitsu> The real question is that once the dust settles, will Bernie supporters back Hillary against Trump?
[02:24] <engineer_bob> I mean at the convention/overall or whatever. I am not sure what he'll win tomorrow.
[02:24] <sporkbomb> Bernie's chances are slim
[02:24] <gawntlet> I think after Bernie looses, he is going to do some dank speech about how his supporters HAVE to get behind clinton because the alternative is trump. He'll pull out the memes. And later in the year, Obama will make some sort of splash
[02:24] <engineer_bob> I think they will Nintendo.
[02:24] <gawntlet> loses*
[02:24] <engineer_bob> But not everyone will, just like not everyone who backs Rubio/Cruz will vote for Trump.
[02:25] <engineer_bob> I want to see how all the northern states vote on the Republican side though. It'll be interesting
[02:25] <mom0momo> Prediction on Tuesday>
[02:25] <gawntlet> that too
[02:25] <jingsly> Is there a good recap of election stuff ?
[02:25] <nintendojitsu> rustled jimmies
[02:26] <jingsly> Not from the home of the bald eagles fox trot Kappa
[02:26] <xenohart238> @Destiny Lincoln tunnel is the easiest challenge mode to farm trust me
[02:26] <engineer_bob> if you google 2016 delegate count it'll give you the current results
[02:26] <engineer_bob> The democrat count is including superdelegates though.
[02:26] <xenohart238> although it looks like you might not be geared enough for challenge modes
[02:27] <nintendojitsu> REKT
[02:27] <wreckoon> most people who critisize sam harris, are misrepresenting him
[02:27] <dizaster0> lolll
[02:27] <itspr0to> >criticizing someone you represent
[02:27] <kharamell> should have 100k dps and 40k hp
[02:27] <gawntlet> hes fine. articulate. but if are someone who wants to learn about atheism, read some academic stuff.
[02:27] <dizaster0> @destiny you dont have the dps for challenge mode
[02:27] <gawntlet> if you are*
[02:27] <dizaster0> @destiny gear up in dankzone then come here
[02:27] <hopewerth> we doing challenges?
06[02:28] * nintendojitsu is an atheist
[02:28] <engineer_bob> This is going to be fun to watch.

[02:29] <lizardwrath> rofl that roll
[02:29] <engineer_bob> The shotgun guys are going to fuck them I think.
[02:29] <engineer_bob> And snipers.
[02:29] <brock4ever> destiny went from a pro sc2 player to this :(
[02:29] <destiny_bot> Destiny updates YouTube regularly now! "DayZ - The Return of the King" posted 11h 29m ago youtu.be/UBVoAA9nvoM
[02:29] <itspr0to> This used to be a level 22 stream
[02:29] <hopewerth> nah those enemies have the least amt of HP so if u play it right they aren't really a problem
[02:29] <nintendojitsu> he really should be doing Dark Zone now
[02:30] <thekordian> FeelsBadMan
[02:30] <liquidfire92> well to be fait sc2 is a ded gaem Kappa
[02:30] <liquidfire92> * fair
[02:30] <hopewerth> but if you don't focus the shotgunner before he gets to you you're fucked
[02:30] <dizaster0> lizardwrath, Thats the snowdrop engine it can dynamically change the animations for odd thing that can happen like him rolling then quickly going to cover.
[02:31] <hopewerth> same with sniper it's easy to not get hit by them since it tells you when they're aiming at you
[02:31] <hopewerth> but if you don't notice he's there and aiming at you again you're fucked
[02:32] <friendlyspartan> destiny wasnt a pro sc2 player he was a pro streamer and still is

[02:41] <gawntlet> 4Head gl. ive never tried jhin. I am usually Lux or Galio
[02:42] <gawntlet> or ziggs
[02:42] <musty_badger> Drop a trap behind you and try and flash his ult then snare him after he comes out on your trap
[02:42] <gawntlet> nice
[02:43] <xgmorrowx> https://www.twitch.tv/brigzz39
[02:44] <musty_badger> Or since he sustain isn't that great, you can always just ult him when he's full. It still does a lot of damage if you hit all shots

[04:48] <gkrat> that's a biohazard not radioatioon
[04:48] <karlcastillo> good night fam
[04:48] <leysama> wwhat is DZ
[04:48] <gofrantiq> Anyone keeping a cpu below 60 C in division?
[04:49] <mudjahydin> DarkZone where you go grind when you lvl30 in this game
[04:49] <leysama> destiny is vl 22?
[04:49] <destiny_bot> Robot Lady will read your message for $5 or more donations twitchalerts.com/donate/destiny
[04:49] <narvisia> No, he just refuses to update the title
[04:50] <mudjahydin> no Leysama 30, and 19 "DZ" lvl
[04:50] <leysama> uh ok. so no minions just get xp from killing mobs ?
[04:50] <leysama> what is a dz level?
[04:50] <unholyownage> Like paragon level in diablo
[04:50] <narvisia> Seperate level for buying stuff in DZ. Stuff is locked until 30/50 DZ lvl
[04:51] <unholyownage> You have a separate level for the dark zone and yeah get rewards at 30/50
[04:51] <leysama> so its a game within the game?
[04:51] <kappakingprime> MoM0MoMo, why don't you expand your market proposition with nudes?
[04:51] <narvisia> Sure xD
[04:51] <thisisacer> i don't understand the appeal of this game
[04:51] <unholyownage> It's a shooter rpg
[04:51] <yura37> you get to run around and shoot sht
[04:52] <mudjahydin> it looks goood thisisacer graphic wise, but it feels boring af FeelsBadMan
[04:52] <thisisacer> Mudjahydin, yeah i feel the same way
[04:52] <yuifxza> !uptime
[04:52] <rca808> This is a worse Destiny
[04:52] <rca808> and Destiny is pretty bad
[04:52] <unholyownage> It's boring to watch and some shit is repetitive. but it's an mmorpg just like wow, there's a lot of grinding for gear
[04:53] <paingame_tj> why are the numbers so big
[04:53] <pathlesscross> THIS IS PEQUAD
[04:53] <unholyownage> people like to play because you're always doing something and chasing better gear
[04:53] <mudjahydin> rtue that, but i dont think fps are made for rpg.. cause grinding an ak putting 30 bullets in the head of someone, is srsly FailFish
[04:53] <thisisacer> Unholyownage, if there is something i hate then it is grinding for stats
[04:53] <fapfapkleenx> Don't like the shit don't watch the shit and don't play the shit. Nuff said.
[04:54] <mudjahydin> true*
[04:54] <rca808> Im watching becasue I like destiny
[04:54] <thisisacer> Fapfapkleenx, i watch destiny, not the game :P
[04:54] <rca808> only reason
[04:54] <leysama> ye i heard alot of streamers didnt like that it takes so much killling
[04:54] <gnavon> Hello chat
[04:54] <tehillusiveman> thats the problem with all fps rpg games
[04:54] <thisisacer> rca808, exactly!
[04:54] <jedimaster44> ok in the dz when a player kills another player does he or she loot your containimated loot or all your loot and gear
[04:54] <tehillusiveman> games are balanced by adding bullet sponges
[04:54] <narvisia> just your DZ loot
[04:55] <jedimaster44> okay thanks @narvisia
[04:55] <mudjahydin> yeah i dont feel fps are made for rpg, just feels strange to put 30 bullets of ak in the head of someone to kill him, it doesnt seems has strage to put your best dps spell 30 times not the same thing
[04:55] <jedimaster44> i thought its your general loot
[04:56] <unholyownage> destiny stop extracting green and blues FailFish
[04:56] <fapfapkleenx> People like new stuff playing shit like call of duty all day gets boring
[04:56] <rca808> Golds the best?
[04:57] <fapfapkleenx> Maybe people like having to shoot shit in the head 30 times to kill it
[04:57] <narvisia> high-end is best gear atm, yeah
[04:57] <jedimaster44> high end gear is like exotic gear from destiny
[04:58] <narvisia> he's triggering me by not getting the wearables xD
[04:58] <negativenighthawk> destiny your stash is full
[04:58] <xxx2mlg4uxxx> is level 22 high?
[04:58] <narvisia> No, and he;s not 22 breh
[04:59] <xxx2mlg4uxxx> not anymore but he was
[04:59] <unholyownage> Seriously I'm so triggered by him not picking up clothes
[04:59] <unholyownage> 22 is not high
[04:59] <rocketwizard> Uh oh.
[04:59] <gnavon> Are there shotguns in this
[04:59] <mudjahydin> yeah
[04:59] <narvisia> Yup
[04:59] <trevorthebigt> you got 3 slots left destiny
[04:59] <mcbandwire> You were 27/30 stash
[04:59] <destiny_bot> Remember to use Destiny's Amazon referral link! destiny.gg/amazon
[04:59] <leysama> last time u had 25 of 30 in ur stash
[05:00] <narvisia> he paid attention to the message this time VoHiYo
[05:01] <rockwood66> they are shooting on pve taget ?
[05:01] <kappakingprime> is this live or a restream?
[05:01] <mudjahydin> y Rocketwizard
[05:01] <narvisia> They are mostly pveing, yes
[05:01] <mudjahydin> rockwood66 y sorry rocket
[05:01] <yura37> its a vod
[05:01] <rockwood66> ^^
[05:01] <narvisia> and that was npcs
[05:01] <leysama> pveing????
[05:01] <mudjahydin> PvE-ing
[05:02] <leysama> whats that
[05:02] <narvisia> PePes vrs Enviroment
[05:02] <relenquished> what is there to do in this game?
[05:02] <narvisia> Challenge mode on story missions,a few other dailies. DZ grind to 50.
[05:03] <eatoats> what happens at 50?
[05:03] <mudjahydin> there is like a "story-line" with mission, then the game is all about grinding, and farming gear, to not PvP, cause you lose too much in PvP
[05:03] <narvisia> You unlock more vendors to buy gear from
[05:04] <eatoats> is this the shooters equivalent to Diablo?
[05:04] <leysama> but didnt they pvp they talked about killing players'
[05:04] <gnavon> So when destiny leaves the DK he goes into his own instance?
[05:05] <narvisia> Yes, but they dont gain anything. They lose hours of DZ grinding progress too
[05:05] <mudjahydin> they backstab one low hp guy, not long ago cause he was solo and low hp, then they run for a minute, to not lose exp @Leysama
[05:05] <narvisia> He can set his game to open and have other players running around, but default is private so only him + invited friends are visible
[05:05] <wtbnerflol> you cant have contaminated items on you, you cant go through the door til you destroy them
[05:05] <gnavon> Ok
[05:06] <narvisia> nice bad meme wtbnerflol xD
[05:06] <gnavon> But even if your game is open you can only pvp in the dark zone?
[05:06] <wtbnerflol> not kidding.
[05:06] <narvisia> You were certaintly wrong xD
[05:09] <gnavon> Night destiny
[05:09] <marfan439> was that flamethrower dude a real player?
[05:09] <nobleprinceps> I just got here. :(

[05:16] <eatoats> hello
[05:17] <urasim> @Destiny you haven't actually seen how liberals defend islam... A liberal that is okay with any repression isn't a liberal, and you see it all over the place. You aren't the target here and you don't know who he's actually talking about. Go around the net and you'll see "islamophe" around all SJW groups. It's disgusting.
[05:17] <kappakingprime> racist KevinTurtle
[05:17] <regemony> @Urasim, regressive left is a better term than liberal
[05:18] <darcyv> much better now. thanks destiny.
[05:18] <tkm27> Ben Affleck is such a cuck
[05:18] <mefjupl> why screen is black?
[05:18] <kreegath> No Ben Affleck is completely righteous
[05:19] <jeffonious> i like ben afflec, but he is wrong on this
[05:19] <mefjupl> TriHard ?
[05:19] <toxicherpes> why is my skin black?
[05:19] <kreegath> The cuck here is Sam Harris and Bill Maher
[05:19] <toxicherpes> maybe cause i have aids
[05:19] <tkm27> na
[05:19] <destiny_bot> Destiny has a new Twitter! twitter.com/OmniDestiny
[05:19] <tkm27> he had that show about his ancestors and tried to hide the fact that they were slave masters
[05:20] <kreegath> What does that have to do with this clip at all?
[05:20] <kreegath> Even if that were true
[05:21] <terrorsphere> Martyrdom was the most annoying perk
[05:21] <posesnus> stream still buffering for me lirikFEELS
[05:21] <tkm27> feels like he has to white knight
[05:21] <kreegath> It's not white knighting to stand up to bigots
[05:21] <deandret> Why is destiny talking about christians?
[05:21] <urasim> @Regemony Regressive left has turned into a pejorative, but I agree that's what the progressive left has turned into. I'd prefer they be called authoritarian leftists as that's what they are. They certainly aren't liberals lol
[05:21] <deandret> Aren't the people on the show only talking about islam?
[05:21] <shorizor> buffers FeelsBadMan
[05:22] <omniscientblue> Funny, ISIS is conservative
[05:22] <eatoats> book burning is an attack on intellectualism, drawing a cartoon is just a bit of fun
[05:22] <deusgero> they both defame the religion though
[05:22] <eatoats> not saying you should be prosecuted though
[05:22] <moshonkel1> is this the ben affleck maher harris thing?
[05:23] <kreegath> yeah
[05:24] <deusgero> Destiny while not everyone gets done for hating islam a lot still do
[05:24] <deusgero> just look at Salmun Rushdie
[05:24] <tkm27> religion NotLikeThis
[05:25] <spr1ggs> How do they get these percentages?
[05:25] <urasim> polls
[05:26] <tkm27> emotional polls Kappa
[05:26] <spr1ggs> And they expect people to take them seriously?
[05:26] <bedovian> just google "pew research polls islam" and you'll probably find what they're citing
[05:26] <heart_lines> destiny streaming late FeelsGoodMan
[05:26] <urasim> yes, because they're accurate
[05:26] <xiso> ben afflack

[05:27] <shorizor> D:
[05:27] <subtachyon> Watch Destiny latch onto one bad example Bill Maher gave and based off of it completely disregard all of his and Harris' other points :D
[05:27] <deusgero> @Spr1ggs, I don't know if you serious but the Islamic world is incredibly backward. There's reasonable cases defending Islam in the west but in the middle east it's litteraly hell
[05:27] <urasim> he's already done that subtachyon
[05:27] <heart_lines> lmao well rip
[05:27] <regemony> Maajid Nawaz is a really interesting person to listen/watch about the criticisms of islam and the fallacy of the regressive left
[05:28] <wreckoon> except we can't watch it
[05:28] <beijon> did he leave? it jsut stopped in middle of him speaking

[00:19] <derpetronicsfacility> @gholatrooper alternatively, sjws might want to "bring democracy" to your country by influencing the polls Kappa
[00:19] <gholatrooper> @Derpetronicsfacility If anything, they will move to Canada, which is great. Because he will start deporting people even before he gets into office 4Head

[00:23] <derpetronicsfacility> @MoM0MoMo, hillary hemorrhages voters left and right, she beats trump by ~1 point right now in head-to-head pools, trump will take the south and independents

[00:23] <m0lonlabe> That ~1 point is within the margin of error. Statistically Trump and Hillary are equal.

[00:24] <mom0momo> Guys

[00:24] <dicedlemming> what if momo built the wall?
[00:24] <liquidfire92> Momo we can only hope we wall off Canada too Kappa

[01:00] <derpetronicsfacility> @gholatrooper dubya would like to have a word with you Kappa
[01:00] <gholatrooper> Actually most people that get rich overnight end up with less money than they started with
[01:00] <tgstarcraft> GholaTrooper, in what welfare system are they allowed to do nothing? in my country you have to look for work to receive welfare, if you deny a job you lose welfare
[01:00] <beegeebus> If you craft a weapon, the only way to get different talents is to craft a new weapon. It's random
[01:00] <yellowthingrules> well if you were bill gates kid and you were born at night you could say the kid got rich overnight

[01:01] <nintendojitsu> #CapitolHillary
[01:01] <gholatrooper> @Yellowthingrules Actually Bill Gates wont give a dollar of his fortune to his kids
[01:01] <yellowthingrules> he said 1% which would still make them rich

[01:02] <mom0momo> Destiny watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMPnUIg8qYY
[01:02] <sickmotherf> just having a rich parents makes its way easier to be rich. even if he doesn't give them money. if he didn't kick them out of his house as soon as they could walk they would have benefited from his wealth

[01:12] <yellowthingrules> 100 meters per second is pretty crazy if you think about it
[01:13] <derpetronicsfacility> ~200mph

[01:21] <gawntlet> amen
[01:21] <yellowthingrules> on the bright side california is now offering assisted suicide, so there is still hope if hillary or trump win
[01:21] <derpetronicsfacility> @gawntlet the short version is many bernie supporters would never vote for hillary under any circumstances, and don't see this as a "one party vs. the other" thing
[01:21] <natescott430> Lemmiiwinks, haHAA 5/7 m8
[01:21] <lemmiiwinks> NateScott430, EleGiggle
[01:21] <bosspanda> where is the node meme
[01:21] <mindofakid> God, she needs to shut up. Racism and systematic oppression of minorities aren't the same thing...although the latter is ingrained in racism
[01:21] <bosspanda> with hillary vs sdanders
[01:21] <bosspanda> sanders*
[01:21] <gawntlet> Derpetronicsfacility yea thats the big issue. its the opposite of Obama v Hillary. Hillary supporters found it easier to go to obama i feel.

[01:53] <cizincho> @GholaTrooper, there are human bosses as well, anyway if damage was realistic in this game there would be no point in adding any of the mmorpg elements to it

[02:08] <esoterikk> A lot of people leave when he's on skype with people too
[02:08] <midvied> @Esoterikk it's mostly because of how the stream is cutting in and out a lot
[02:08] <thxmanny> after he officially retired from SC2, everyone kinda just stopped watching this stream
[02:09] <midvied> @Mmogosu I don't think it's cux tbh
[02:09] <esoterikk> @thxmanny, he is consistently at 1500 viewers even if he is doing nothing
[02:09] <xxmjspecterxx> @Gholatrooper Only if you believe in yourself, Ms. uncertified grill Kappa
[02:09] <gallo_eddy> It's the stream Bing buggy
[02:09] <midvied> @Mmogosu if he was being cuxed, he would notice it
[02:09] <pilebum> yeah he averages 1500, wierd for him to have such low count, maybe its twitch

[02:25] <destiny_bot> Remember to use Destiny's Amazon referral link! destiny.gg/amazon
[02:26] <melissus> sadly :(
[02:26] <pilebum> Oh it sure does, his stream has been going downhill past 1-2 years, he hasnt learned to netowrk or find his new footing in this new age twitch
[02:26] <pilebum> Ide argue best thing he could do for his career is get more involved with twitch
[02:26] <curtsy> Ahh I got it, you're memeing, Carry on.
[02:26] <gallo_eddy> "More involved" Sounds like he needs a partner
[02:26] <pilebum> I wish I was memig honestly
[02:27] <rauros47> who are you talking about
[02:27] <gallo_eddy> Doesn't seem like he'll do anything to further himself by the looks of it
[02:27] <gholatrooper> I have no idea what you are talking about, Destiny has a collection the most hardcore memers on twitch Kappa
[02:27] <pilebum> itr true though and sad to see
[02:27] <gallo_eddy> Eh, he just needs help
[02:27] <pilebum> Just annoying to see some of theseother streamers doing better then him, when he is a better streamer and been around longer
[02:27] <pilebum> Like back in 2011 and 201 he was always on skype with other streamers etc
[02:28] <gallo_eddy> @pilebum that's his problem
[02:28] <pilebum> Now its like just obsucure epsorts people no one knows about
[02:28] <gallo_eddy> Him being such an old streamer having refreshing content can be hard
[02:28] <pilebum> JP has done it,. very well
[02:28] <gallo_eddy> Usually people run out of ideas the longer they do something that requires such work
[02:28] <pilebum> So has day9 etc
[02:28] <gallo_eddy> Well he isn't them by the looks of it
[02:29] <pilebum> No but they adapted quite well i WULD ARGUE
[02:29] <pilebum> Caps
[02:29] <pilebum> Inctonrol and other people in same boat as destiny though
[02:29] <gallo_eddy> Then why hasn't Des done it?
[02:29] <pilebum> Real shame to see incontrol with 300 viewers with his personality
[02:29] <gallo_eddy> I just feel he needs a helping hand
[02:29] <gallo_eddy> That one friend who knows how to fix the shit he doesn't and vise versa
[02:30] <pilebum> Yeah would just hate to see the old sc2 streamers in next 2 years fall to like obscutiry, would suck as
[02:30] <melissus> !live
[02:30] <destiny_bot> Live with 452 viewers for ~4h 57m
[02:30] <pilebum> ass
[02:30] <gallo_eddy> I feel ya :/
[02:30] <melissus> it's gonna happen man
[02:31] <gallo_eddy> Sooner or later it will
[02:31] <gallo_eddy> Nothing lasts forever in this world
[02:31] <ultracloudx> LMAOO
[02:31] <ultracloudx> the cuckening
[02:31] <wbj_knife> @Gallo_eddy the world doesn't even last forever #deep
[02:31] <gallo_eddy> Point proven
[02:31] <pilebum> ps4masterace
[02:31] <pilebum> just sayin
[02:32] <gallo_eddy> Shut cho beech ass up Kappa
[02:32] <dmannn12> whats destinys gear liek guys
[02:32] <potioncellar> I wasn't here two years ago, but Destiny seems to be doing fine, no? Average 1.5 to 2k viewers.
[02:32] <gallo_eddy> @dmannn12 nooby
[02:32] <pilebum> Destiny 2 years ago was getting double the viewers
[02:32] <potioncellar> That's playing any game, too.
[02:32] <pilebum> he was getting 4-6k
[02:32] <gallo_eddy> @potioncellar In his standards of views, that's low
[02:33] <potioncellar> He streamed SC2 a few weeks ago a lot and was getting 4k+
[02:33] <dmannn12> MrDestructoid viewbot MrDestructoid
[02:33] <perfectskye> Yeah, I was here for that potion.
[02:33] <pilebum> yeah that was his daily average back in day, from what I remember him idra and day9 were top sc2 streamers
[02:33] <gallo_eddy> @dmannn12 Read info friend HeyGuys
[02:33] <thxmanny> looks like his viewer base is concentrated on SC2
[02:33] <pilebum> But sc2 always had like 20k watching then
[02:33] <thxmanny> type casted streamer
[02:33] <pilebum> we were top 3 on twitch
[02:33] <plexxtt> ya. nobody wants to watch him play the division
[02:33] <forbitz> damn that dude in north korea got 15 years hard labor
[02:34] <thxmanny> I do :(
[02:34] <gallo_eddy> Nobody cares about North Korea
[02:34] <potioncellar> 2k viewers playing any game seems to be solid, right?
[02:34] <perfectskye> Makes you wonder, ya know, if Destiny decided to do a scheduled event, would it boost his numbers globally, or would it only cause a surge for said event? Like SC2 coaching?
[02:34] <perfectskye> Or just game mechanics training.
[02:34] <beijon> was destiny opular when he streamed lol in s3
[02:34] <gallo_eddy> We just watch and learn what not to do to be like them
[02:34] <forbitz> Bet that dude does
[02:35] <gallo_eddy> @perfectskye That actually sounds like a good idea
[02:35] <forbitz> he wasnt that popular at lol
[02:35] <beijon> i see
[02:35] <forbitz> played draven a lot
[02:35] <perfectskye> Definitely. If you ask anyone, their favorite memories of Steven are from his time hard memeing about Mechanics.
[02:35] <pilebum> Destiny needs to find new viewers outside of sc2, thats his problem. Like majoirty of people here I bet been watchiing destiny for over a year, dont think he gets many new viewers
[02:35] <subtachyon> is destiny still playing this pile of shit?
[02:35] <destiny_bot> Destiny updates YouTube regularly now! "Playing Tom Clancy's The Division with @LycanGTV" posted 11h 35m ago youtu.be/DNnADOVjrWI
[02:36] <renownzz> Why is your twitch destiny thats a video game what haha
[02:36] <potioncellar> I feel like his core viewership that will follow him until the ends of the Earth is really high though.
[02:37] <gallo_eddy> @renownzz He made it before the game
[02:37] <pilebum> @renownzz, ass fuck he was Destiny before there was a destiny
[02:37] <pilebum> He IS the Destiny
[02:37] <potioncellar> He was getting 2k viewers playing Stardew Valley.
[02:37] <renownzz> @gallo_eddy @pilebum no he is not
[02:37] <pilebum> Uhmm yeah he is
[02:37] <renownzz> @pilebum who are you kid
[02:37] <gallo_eddy> @renownzz Un okay
[02:37] <pilebum> He sbeen streaming under Destiny since 2011, has the destiny subreddit etc
[02:37] <perfectskye> What the fuck?
[02:37] <pilebum> Get rekt kiddo
[02:37] <pilebum> REKT
[02:37] <gallo_eddy> I don't argue with people who will potentially kills my brain cells
[02:38] <pilebum> Who am I??
[02:38] <pilebum> Im a big deal, thats who I am
[02:38] <renownzz> I fundamentally disagree with your deceptive assertion
[02:38] <ultracloudx> is this the new gears of war
[02:38] <perfectskye> GUYS NO. he's a memer. Let him be.
[02:38] <gallo_eddy> "Fundamentally disagree"
[02:38] <gallo_eddy> Oh god
[02:38] <gallo_eddy> He killed one D:
[02:38] <gallo_eddy> "Mute" NotLikeThis
[02:38] <renownzz> @gallo_eddy you must be disconcerted man
[02:38] <perfectskye> All I got from that sentence was "Malady?"
[02:39] <thxmanny> I'll be your fourth @Destiny
[02:39] <bosspanda> are the cux memes still going on?
[02:39] <bosspanda> orrrr are we gucci
[02:39] <pilebum> Whenevr I hear Mlady now.. I just think of Destinys Blue Coat
[02:39] <chippuhhh> dg
[02:39] <bosspanda> i see he has only 570 viewers
[02:39] <bosspanda> so i assume it's still going on
[02:39] <perfectskye> It's not so bad, but it's been bad all evening.
[02:39] <bosspanda> and it's bad
[02:39] <gallo_eddy> No we're Loius Vietnam
[02:39] <thxmanny> I'm ready to go in coach, just give me a chance, I know there's a lot running on it but it's all psychological...all you really need is a positive frame of mind
[02:40] <gallo_eddy> >Crawling out of grenade range
[02:40] <pilebum> Like ion Destiny the MMO feeling of having enemies take high dps, seems realistic. I mean shooting aliens. But this game... having to shoot 50 rounds in a human for them to die
[02:40] <chippuhhh> lemme
[02:40] <pilebum> Just seems ridiculous
[02:40] <gallo_eddy> Triggeer warning Vietnam flashback
[02:41] <beijon> oddly the stream doesnt loead back in when cuxed, have to manually reload
[02:41] <perfectskye> Small pox gives bullet resilience.
[02:41] <perfectskye> It's been proven.
[02:41] <nagasee> this mission doesnt look easier than the one they were doing before
[02:41] <gallo_eddy> It's cause they're nubs
[02:41] <ultracloudx> LOL
[02:41] <pilebum> Lik that
[02:41] <beijon> lol
[02:42] <pilebum> Wtf is that shit lmao
[02:42] <beijon> hahah that bullet sponge
[02:42] <perfectskye> And yes, this game plays eerily like Destiny, but the PVP element isn't bad. OKAY BUT THIS IS .
[02:42] <the_sneaky_goose> that just made this game look rly bad
[02:42] <gallo_eddy> You bet it did
[02:42] <perfectskye> Yeah, I was trying to support it holy shit.
[02:42] <pilebum> I cant deal with that, high DPS like this on a hum for FPS games.
[02:42] <pilebum> Just seems so unrealistic and retarded
[02:43] <perfectskye> Would your perception of the bullet sponge aspect change if they were zombles?
[02:43] <pilebum> Maybe, just an anemy where it makes it bilievable
[02:43] <gallo_eddy> @pilebum it's only because their equipment isn't nearly close to do this challenge mode
[02:43] <gallo_eddy> But yea in some instances bullet sponges shouldn't be a thing
[02:43] <perfectskye> yeah, the scaling affects the perception.
[02:43] <gallo_eddy> Like, at all
[02:44] <gallo_eddy> There should be boss mechanics, making the game that more challenging and fun
[02:44] <pilebum> Yeah idk was thinking of getting this game with the amount Summ1t and Destiny have been playing it..
[02:44] <gallo_eddy> Bullet sponges are the back wash of boss mechanics
[02:44] <pilebum> But meh Ill just wit for Dark Souls 3 i think
[02:44] <perfectskye> Yeah, I mean, there could've been a much more challenging and enticing game development. Money and research into combat scenarios.
[02:44] <pilebum> 59.99 games one a season for me
[02:44] <perfectskye> But Dumping time and code into scaling equipment and damage is easy for getting a game out on time.
[02:45] <gallo_eddy> @perfectskye Poor excuse of getting an early payday
[02:45] <perfectskye> I absolutely agree.
[02:45] <pilebum> Well does seem people are enjoying it, I think they oput the time into it I just think they added maybe the mma scaling aspect after Destiny came out
[02:45] <pilebum> Think this was in dev same time as destiny was too
[02:45] <destiny_bot> Destiny has a new Twitter! twitter.com/OmniDestiny
[02:45] <perfectskye> Interesting.
[02:46] <gallo_eddy> I mean I won't knock the fact that they will include free content updates frequently for anyone with a simple enough brain to play this and enjoy it, that I respect, but anything else. . .
[02:46] <perfectskye> Looking past the ridiculousness of the DPS and absorption rate of bullets, this game is fun to watch.
[02:46] <pilebum> Agreed perfect
[02:46] <perfectskye> I wouldn't feel stimulated playing it myself, but that's why I'm here with you all and with Destiny.
[02:47] <rca808> Are these real players?
[02:47] <gallo_eddy> I just watch a use he's having fun
[02:47] <gallo_eddy> @rca808 They're bullet sponges
[02:47] <the_sneaky_goose> like the enemies have sooo muc health and do sooo muc damage its like wtf
[02:47] <gallo_eddy> @rca808 NPC's so no

[02:52] <bosspanda> Europeans are some of the biggest shit talkers from what i have observed
[02:52] <ig_zodiac> It's more like a napalm strike in the voice comms
[02:52] <bosspanda> not to hate on them i think it's just in their genes
[02:52] <bosspanda> to be assholes
[02:53] <gallo_eddy> They're just salty from how much FREEDOM we have
[02:53] <bosspanda> i think hitler influenced them
[02:53] <gallo_eddy> "Freedom"
[02:53] <kreegath> Europeans are smug, Americans are arrogant
[02:53] <lordlynkz> now that you bitches are alive and talking... I'm going

[03:00] <bosspanda> Trump is literally gonna reverse everything obama has done
[03:00] <bosspanda> he's gonna make marijuana illegal and put people in prison for life
[03:01] <bosspanda> for smoking marihuana

[03:06] <melissus> his own butler called him out on it, and that's what he said lol
[03:06] <the_sneaky_goose> Are enemies more powerful/appear in greater numbers if you're playing with friends? @Destiny
[03:06] <ig_zodiac> and killing people you don't like is key to that
[03:07] <beegeebus> Rush mask
[03:07] <beegeebus> @Destiny,

[03:13] <ashes2049> it might also be new twitch tech that is not counting the viewers from his own website
[03:13] <melissus> that might be the case
[03:13] <kreegath> No Cox started having problems again
[03:13] <jtmarino9> ah that could be it....his other chat seems to be moving
[03:13] <melissus> if true ;)
[03:13] <ig_zodiac> not enough hamsters in the server room
[03:13] <ashes2049> his internet is a lot better now
[03:13] <ashes2049> still a few problems though, much less though

[12:11] <yulie355> This is SFM
[12:11] <sustentaculum> SFM?
[12:11] <legendarydisappointment> lol this looks like garbage
[12:11] <kmagekris> what is happening
[12:11] <soarlozer> its pretty cool but if this was a game it would be shit lol
[12:11] <pontus01> does he read twitch chat or only his websites?
[12:12] <runaro_net> Hm.. that fixxed it for me. Sorry to hear that.
[12:12] <yulie355> pretty much only his websites
[12:12] <riquiz> ^

[12:12] <pontus01> thanks
[12:12] <zhelidz> He reads both
[12:13] <blivinity> Agree.
[12:13] <issashine> >implying destiny reads twitch chat FeelsBadMan
[12:13] <proxa> the text sitting on the top webcam border is triggering me
[12:13] <deandret> what's wrong with the current setup
[12:13] <roughrunner98> do you really need chat on screen
[12:14] <deandret> for videos
[12:14] <itsmurda> check out reckfuls stream he has chat and a webcam @Destiny
[12:14] <korvgrillaren> !momoblues
[12:14] <roughrunner98> or is that where you read it from
[12:14] <soarlozer> i dont get the point of having chat on stream
[12:14] <visceral_> Man that would be super easy to make in Photoshoö...
[12:14] <itsmurda> its good for mobile users @Soarlozer
[12:14] <zoniczama> I'm pretty sure he never reads Twitch FeelsBadMan
[12:14] <soarlozer> oh
[12:14] <pontus01> What do you think of athene matching his 1 million dollar fund rais to an exact moment in dreamhack? He got the exact 1 million on his stage time(stage time was like 5 min)
[12:14] <hi_bread_> since theater mode is a thing theres no point in having it onthe screen
[12:14] <vividzor> chat on stream is because this is his other chat so if people see it on stream they might think about going over there
[12:15] <calimond> best layout is obviously the one kaceytron uses
[12:15] <hyuna_the_hyena> @Destiny, did you consider using double chat layout for both D.gg and Twitch chat? A lot of twitch/afreeca cross streamers do that and it works well
[12:15] <drachbar> Make the gaming window smaller? aaaKappa
[12:15] <roughrunner98> i really dont think having the chat on stream is necessary
[12:16] <kharamell> 4:3 with a column on the side for cam and chat?
[12:16] <disconightfever> destiny's own chat wont be recorded with twitch
[12:16] <disconightfever> so i think its fine imo
[12:16] <roughrunner98> o right

[15:47] <kappakingprime> TheThing
[15:47] <cizincho> it's unplayable on consoles so they can have it 1 year earlier, nobody gives a shit
[15:47] <aliya227> Lol I have Xbox just asking
[15:47] <mrobbin> So this is a grinding-game?
[15:47] <mrobbin> Where you grind all the time?
[15:47] <dicedlemming> yes
[15:47] <mar45690> @mrobbin yes
[15:47] <mar45690> Like destiny the game
[15:47] <mrobbin> How can you not get totally sick of this sht?
[15:47] <dicedlemming> you grind impossible missions longer than anyone else and then shoot them in an unfair battle and claim you outplayed them
[15:47] <pacjax> bUrself
[15:47] <cizincho> it's pretty addictive
[15:47] <destiny_bot> Remember to use Destiny's Amazon referral link! destiny.gg/amazon
[15:47] <cizincho> it's like diablo
[15:47] <crigget> Are there classes in this game
[15:48] <kappakingprime> it's like skyrim with guns nathanDank
[15:48] <dicedlemming> yes, the people who use a vector close range and then the bad players are the 2 classes
[15:48] <mrobbin> lol
[15:48] <cizincho> :D
[15:48] <mar45690> @kappakingprime LUL
[15:48] <itsjustcrow> the only thing addictive so far are those amazing hoodie memes
[15:48] <crigget> I'd play this game if you could roll a wizard OMGScoots
[15:48] <mrobbin> He's just standing there shooting

[15:49] <mrobbin> Critical Hit damage
[15:49] <mrobbin> Beautiful
[15:49] <mrobbin> Apparently moving doesn't seem to give much of an advantage in this game
[15:49] <cizincho> it's better to play this game, it feels pretty good FeelsGoodMan
[15:49] <kappakingprime> how much are mana potions in this game?
[15:49] <itsmedonny> will this be better than destiny long term? people are still playing that a year and a half later
[15:49] <mrobbin> So this is free 2 play?
[15:49] <gothkoth> Critical Hit in shooter Kappa THAT ONE BULLET was definitely better than rest of your shitty magazine Kappa
[15:50] <cizincho> i played both and i like division better so far
[15:50] <mrobbin> Seems very realistic tom clancy like that you stand in front of a guy for a whole minute and empty 5 magazines in his face
[15:50] <dicedlemming> itsmedonny, dunno, destiny had some rly good DLC to keep it alive, this game needs additions like that to have the same longevity as well IMO
[15:50] <kappakingprime> is this game a real esport tho?
[15:50] <crigget> Go in cover right next to the boss KaRappa
[15:50] <cizincho> @KappaKingPrime, Kappa
[15:51] <mrobbin> This looks uber boring
[15:51] <mrobbin> Numbercrunching time
[15:51] <mrobbin> residentSleeper
[15:51] <gothkoth> @mrobbin, Tom Clancy is dead. I think he`s been dead before they even started making this game
[15:51] <cizincho> if you don't like diablo you prob not gonna like this game
[15:51] <mrobbin> Yeah just saying, tom clancy games used to be "realistic"
[15:52] <mrobbin> Diablo looks more fun then that
[15:52] <crigget> The trailer made this game look sick FeelsBadMan
[15:52] <dicedlemming> oh hey they talked about the 3 upcoming DLCs
[15:52] <dicedlemming> We know that three paid-for expansions will be released by Ubisoft, "The Underground expansion will send you to hunt enemies in the vast mazes of tunnels and subways that run under Manhattan.
[15:52] <mrobbin> This looks like a worse ME3
[15:52] <dicedlemming> "Underground will be followed by Survival later in the summer, which will challenge you to survive for as long as possible in a very hostile environment while gathering supplies and equipment.
[15:52] <dicedlemming> "Finally, Last Stand will arrive along with winter, challenging players with a new, relentless threat."
[15:52] <itsjustcrow> So why does Destiny's character look exactly the same as he did when we was level 6
[15:52] <itsjustcrow> I thought this was an RPG
[15:52] <crigget> Where are the spiky shoulderpads OMGScoots
[15:52] <cizincho> yeah like you can figure out what is the game like by watching how somebody else playing it Kappa
[15:52] <dicedlemming> ItsJustCrow, because art assets are the most laborious part of most games
[15:52] <dicedlemming> ItsJustCrow, that shit isnt cheap m8
[15:53] <gothkoth> @DICEDLEMMING, enlighten me with your RTS player prediction. What exactly is this new threat? More sponges? Kappa
[15:53] <dicedlemming> ItsJustCrow, its like a 5:1 ratio artists:programmers
[15:53] <dicedlemming> GothKoth, its going to be fucking zombies
[15:53] <itsjustcrow> FeelsBadMan
[15:54] <gothkoth> @DICEDLEMMING, I`m speechless. Honestly. What. The. Fuck
[15:54] <issashine> tfw destiny will never stop playing this boring af game ResidentSleeper
[15:54] <dicedlemming> im just guessing GothKoth LUL
[15:54] <dicedlemming> GothKoth, but cmon, its call of duty zombie mode, its gonna be zombies
[15:54] <40ftwalrus> "infected" not zombies bruh cmon
[15:54] <dicedlemming> GothKoth, or something that acts much like zombies
[15:54] <kehrin_> this framerate WutFace
[15:54] <cizincho> witcher 3 looked boring as fuck to me when i watched streamers play it, but it's one of the best rpg's i played in a long time
[15:55] <itsjustcrow> This game would actually make more fucking sense
[15:55] <scottasd> Already finished today's challenge mode it was easy
[15:55] <itsjustcrow> if they were killing zombies
[15:55] <natescott430> Kehrin_, Do you hate glorious cinematics or something? KAPOW
[15:55] <itsjustcrow> instead of adamantium hoodies
[15:55] <dicedlemming> the AI acts like zombies
[15:55] <gothkoth> oh come on. Witcher at least had the catchy LELELELELELE tune
[15:55] <dicedlemming> they're dumb as hell and just run out in the open
[15:55] <itsjustcrow> LUL
[15:55] <issashine> oh boy look destiny is playing another generic cover shoo- ResidentSleeper
[15:55] <bowser333> Run the Russian mission on challenge
[15:56] <gawntlet> I just cant wait for Destiny spending hours n hours trying to kill a boss in Darl Souls 3 Kreygasm
[15:56] <issashine> does anyone wanna play paragon with me FeelsGoodMan
[15:56] <natescott430> oh wowee Issashine complaining about this game agai- ResidentSleeper
[15:56] <natescott430> Kappa
[15:56] <kappakingprime> DICEDLEMMING, he's already getting cucked every now and then, smarter ai would make dusty quit or start compulsively restarting the game LUL
[15:57] <dicedlemming> well to make it challenging they just up the numbers
[15:57] <grebnerachs> love to see this fucking misogynistic cunts stream finally die
[15:57] <bigmace> LUL
[15:57] <gawntlet> DuckerZ
[15:57] <tearsc2> How is this even fun? can shooting someone 2000 times in the head just to kill them be fun?
[15:57] <dicedlemming> with challenging AI they could tune the difficulty another way
[15:57] <destiny_bot> Destiny updates YouTube regularly now! "Destiny's Munchpak Snack Review" posted 57m ago youtu.be/_p6Nvc2aBhw
[15:57] <cizincho> people complaining about realism in video games 4Head
[15:57] <pacjax> Grebnerachs, SeemsGood
[15:58] <dicedlemming> like making the environment/map matter more, bad situation surrounded by spooky enemies who actually do things
[15:58] <kappakingprime> WutFace
[15:58] <dicedlemming> but instead they just go ok well now the damage is 2000 instead of 400 OuO
[15:58] <natescott430> LUL
[15:58] <issashine> TearSC2, the joke is this game isn't fun at all EleGiggle
[15:58] <kappakingprime> DICEDLEMMING, but that costs money to develop
[15:58] <gothkoth> @TearSC2, it`s one of top played games now. Guess the problems lies within our sceptical approach Kappa
[15:58] <kappakingprime> numbers are free LUL
[15:58] <natescott430> Wait, why aren't my bttv emotes working?
[15:58] <cizincho> @Issashine, have you played it? 4Head
[15:58] <kappakingprime> NateScott430, emotes are sub only nathanFather
[15:58] <tearsc2> @GothKoth, should just buy it, if people play it, it HAS to be good Kappa
[15:58] <issashine> Cizincho, yes i preordered itn
[15:59] <everyonelovesprime> the women men ratio in this game is absurd
[15:59] <stealthsin> my only complain about the game atm is how lackluster end game is
[15:59] <saucycef> TearSC2, you should literally never play an RPG or MMO
[15:59] <cizincho> @Issashine, FeelsBadMan
[15:59] <mar45690> @natescott430 nathanFather
[15:59] <issashine> LOOK AT THAT AMAZING ENEMY AI WOW SO GOOD PogChamp

[15:59] <tearsc2> @SaucyCEF, haha maybe I should try then, since i love RPGs ^^. Just hard to imagine it as a shooter
[16:00] <gothkoth> @TearSC2, Holy fuck, how did you make this up? Kappa I`ve been contemplating this game since it came out, and failed to come to conclusion Kappa
[16:00] <stealthsin> challenge missions are easy so it just becomes doing them over and over again
[16:00] <mar45690> @natescott430 it cause BTTB hates you morTarga
[16:00] <natescott430> But I can't see them, only the text, a shadow of what I lost...
[16:00] <thafortune> is the max lvl 30 or? i seem to be able to lvl to 32 or smth

[19:07] <mar45690> Kappa
[19:07] <ivanventura01> assuming your race is better than the next is called racisim
[19:07] <bestmanateena> it's funny how scared people are of muslims, when they're more likely to be shot on the street than they are be blown up by a muslim
[19:07] <themartyraion> What has trump said that promotes white supremecy?
[19:07] <kappakingprime> ANELE
[19:07] <ivanventura01> do i really have to list it?

[19:08] <destiny_bot> Remember to use Destiny's Amazon referral link! destiny.gg/amazon
[19:08] <saynsh> i dont really believe trump is a racist, he is a dufus though, not a president
[19:08] <onewithbeer> stream is gone?
[19:08] <omatherius> @Ivanventura01 claims are traditionally supported by facts in any conversation held between two adults
[19:08] <kappakingprime> mrw cucks are trying to have a meaningful conversation here LUL
[19:08] <themartyraion> so like every liberal ever
[19:08] <crazyman64335> hey
[19:08] <themartyraion> "he just is racist
[19:08] <themartyraion> "
[19:08] <ivanventura01> if this convo was worth it
[19:08] <ivanventura01> never said it like that
[19:08] <themartyraion> "he just is white supremecist"
[19:08] <ipickflowers> not you DansGame
[19:08] <gh3tto_monk> ivan is just baiting, you tards
[19:08] <saynsh> nah martyr
[19:08] <saynsh> stop generalizing
[19:09] <helloimpulse> He's not
[19:09] <iamscarzi> KappaKingPrime, implying it isnt all shitposting LUL
[19:09] <saynsh> you sound like Trump Kappa
[19:09] <helloimpulse> He's bringing up the point of how every election the left calls the right racists
[19:09] <themartyraion> you guys know why stereotypes exist in the first place?
[19:09] <bestmanateena> Because a large portion of republicans are racist...
[19:09] <saynsh> and every elwction the right calls the left pussies who hate MURICA
[19:09] <helloimpulse> Because the trailer trash isn't going to be voting for the democrats?
[19:10] <alexsq5> evil white men Kappa the TheMartyrAion
[19:10] <helloimpulse> Or the people on welfare aren't going to be voting for the Republicans?
[19:10] <bestmanateena> You know it's funny, a lot of republican economic policies are pretty decent, but social/foreign policies just take the cake for Grade A level retardness
[19:10] <helloimpulse> LUL
[19:10] <themartyraion> I mean there's more Muslims globally that want Shariah Law wherever they live than not. That's pretty radical
[19:10] <ivanventura01> lol i mean if u dont think that man is a racist or believes in some type of white supremeacy youre pretty blind to reality
[19:10] <bestmanateena> Republicans have gotten the U.S into a disgusting amount of wars
[19:10] <ivanventura01> the man wants to deport immigrants
[19:10] <themartyraion> Ivan shush you have no evidence
[19:11] <themartyraion> illegal immigrants
[19:11] <helloimpulse> Ivan is just baiting

[19:11] <ipickflowers> Lemmiiwinks, HeyGuys
[19:11] <ivanventura01> yes illegal immigrants but do u understand what it takes to do something like that?
[19:11] <helloimpulse> welcome to my ignore, along with pacjax EleGiggle
[19:12] <ivanventura01> do u understand how thedeportation of immigrants will fuck this economy?
[19:12] <ivanventura01> do u read?
[19:12] <saynsh> end of discussion, I wouldnt want a world leader with that kind of a combover
[19:12] <bestmanateena> The reason why is because this same sort of immigration xenophobia has already happened in the 1850's by a part called the know-nothings
[19:12] <helloimpulse> How will it fuck the economy?
[19:12] <ivanventura01> youre ignorant LMAO
[19:12] <helloimpulse> That's a rash point to bring up
[19:12] <helloimpulse> Oh, and now you don't answer the question
[19:12] <themartyraion> OH NO! People can't exploit illegals anymore whatever will we dooooo
[19:12] <ivanventura01> illegal immigrants do all the jobs you ppl dont want to do
[19:12] <comfy_weather> What's everyone in chats favourite meme?
[19:12] <ivanventura01> they do all the dirty tough and low wage jobs white ppl wont be bothered to do
[19:13] <bestmanateena> Who were scared shitless of irish catholic immigrants and german immigrants, mainly because thhey were afraid of losing an english majority
[19:13] <themartyraion> there's a lot of college grads living in their mom's basements that will take those jobs
[19:13] <helloimpulse> Illegal immigrants are given slave labor
[19:13] <ivanventura01> no lol
[19:13] <helloimpulse> It's not about the jobs we don't want to do
[19:13] <saynsh> stop being racist ivan
[19:13] <helloimpulse> I bet you're not even old enough to vote Ivan
[19:13] <ivanventura01> now im being racist?
[19:13] <helloimpulse> Why are you even trying to debate
[19:13] <saynsh> we dont need racism in this chat
[19:13] <ivanventura01> lmaooooo0o0o
[19:13] <bestmanateena> @Helloimpulse, you're wrong, immigration in the long run is beneficial for an economy

[19:13] <tizzit_gaming> HeyGuys will destiny come back or is he done for today?
[19:14] <ivanventura01> you guys are ignorant as shit theres no sign of intelligence for at least a mmile
[19:14] <helloimpulse> @Bestmanateena Yea dawg, immigration, you know the type that requires work visas
[19:14] <helloimpulse> lmao
[19:14] <bestmanateena> Europe should actually be happy they're getting immigrants because their population is declining, like Japan's, and soon the old people are gonna outnumber the young immensely.
[19:14] <ivanventura01> go vote for trump tho if thatll make you happy
[19:14] <ivanventura01> scumbags
[19:14] <liquidfire92> ok I will
[19:14] <themartyraion> @Rysst, if there's no illegals to hire they have to pay minimum wage and bring working conditions up to labor standards
[19:14] <liquidfire92> Kappa
[19:14] <themartyraion> duh
[19:14] <saynsh> stop generalizing ivan, youre no better than trump
[19:14] <ipickflowers> Liquidfire92, type 9

[19:14] <ipickflowers> SeemsGood
[19:14] <ivanventura01> more ignorance
[19:14] <bestmanateena> @Helloimpulse, you know we let hardly any legal immigrants in right? The people who are illegally immigrating aren't trying to take jobs because they hate you, they're trying to support their families because life elsewhere is fucking awful
[19:15] <saynsh> you sure act like it
[19:15] <ivanventura01> keep spewing it tho
[19:15] <bestmanateena> and a lot of people die just getting to the place they want to be
[19:15] <tizzit_gaming> food or strum over? DansGame
[19:15] <themartyraion> population argument is a meme

[19:15] <bestmanateena> holy shittt
[19:15] <memegotchi> nice stat Kappa
[19:15] <bestmanateena> you must actually be a troll
[19:15] <ivanventura01> you kids are fucking stupid
[19:15] <helloimpulse> And most of those people aren't being given actual wages. Have you even applied for a job?
[19:15] <ivanventura01> its real sad
[19:15] <saynsh> now thats some serious raping
[19:15] <helloimpulse> There's a box you have to check that says "I am able to work in the United States"
[19:16] <themartyraion> have you heard of tarrarush?
[19:16] <themartyraion> it's the muslim tradition
[19:16] <ivanventura01> youre all pussies
[19:16] <saynsh> then at least you cant claim theyre being lazy martyr
[19:16] <themartyraion> lol
[19:16] <themartyraion> true
[19:17] <themartyraion> they gathered in a group 1000 strong in Cologne on New Years Eve to molest, rape and rob any and every girl they found
[19:17] <saynsh> but yeah i think you have a really warped view muslims in general martyr
[19:17] <bestmanateena> you know what would actually fix the illegal immigration problem?
[19:17] <themartyraion> No sir I just pay attention
[19:17] <saynsh> i dont know if you know any muslims irl
[19:17] <bestmanateena> is actually allowing them to enter legally so they can be taxed
[19:17] <helloimpulse> Or you know
[19:17] <bestmanateena> instead of wasting money deporting thousands of them
[19:18] <themartyraion> Manatee did you know that's a Trump policy?
[19:18] <destiny_bot> Destiny updates YouTube regularly now! "Destiny's Munchpak Snack Review" posted 4h 17m ago youtu.be/_p6Nvc2aBhw
[19:18] <saynsh> but the ones I know are fuckin chill as fuk
[19:18] <helloimpulse> Abolish third world countires
[19:18] <themartyraion> expediting and improving the legal immigration process
[19:18] <helloimpulse> Easier said than done though
[19:18] <bestmanateena> That's also hillary's policy and that's also bernie's policy, what's your point?
[19:18] <memegotchi> i like how we go from mexicans to muslims interchangeably DuckerZ
[19:18] <ivanventura01> all idiots lmaop
[19:18] <bestmanateena> you think that a lot of republicans supporting trump don't want to illegally deport immigrants?
[19:18] <saynsh> same thing meme

[19:19] <bestmanateena> And you can bet your sweet ass the drug cartels that own mexico aren't going to spend money on that wall
[19:19] <saynsh> nooo stop

[19:19] <sirknighter> Wheres destiny

[19:20] <themartyraion> building a wall blocks a route
[19:20] <helloimpulse> Do you really think he is going to build a wall
[19:20] <pacjax> lol
[19:20] <pacjax> where did he go
[19:20] <themartyraion> and it allows border patrol to focus other areas
[19:20] <themartyraion> Yes he will build a literal wall
[19:20] <thekogut> Where did he just go?
[19:20] <saynsh> isnt there already a fence?
[19:20] <themartyraion> and Mexico will pay for it
[19:20] <bestmanateena> I think he wants to build a wall, I can bet you all my life savings mexico wouldn't pay for it
[19:20] <themartyraion> they will
[19:20] <themartyraion> because our trade defecit with them
[19:20] <thekogut> It just got 10 feet higher

[19:21] <pacjax> ipickflowers, where is destiny HeyGuys
[19:21] <bestmanateena> what do you mean?
[19:21] <helloimpulse> Trump pressures them to do it and they will
[19:21] <themartyraion> Hello is right
[19:21] <bestmanateena> ok first off @Helloimpulse do you have an economics degree?
[19:21] <themartyraion> It may not feel good at the end
[19:21] <themartyraion> but
[19:21] <bestmanateena> What sort of debt are you talking about? trade debt?
[19:21] <memegotchi> if you think a trade deficit means they owe us then ur an A+ troll BrokeBack
[19:21] <bestmanateena> you know guys
[19:22] <saynsh> personally i think you guys should just dig a big ditch along the border, fill it with water and get a huge fallbridge as the single point of entrance
[19:22] <themartyraion> US is in such bad debt worldwide because of leaders that have no business sense and are too worried to look bad globally to use our leverage in foreign trade
[19:22] <memegotchi> Kreygasm
[19:22] <bestmanateena> thank you memegotchi i was going to say that
[19:22] <bestmanateena> yo
[19:22] <bestmanateena> for real though
[19:22] <bestmanateena> let's stop arguing cause nothings gonna change
[19:22] <bestmanateena> can we be real about something
[19:22] <destiny_bot> Let someone else talk; 10m
[19:22] <iamscarzi> DuckerZ
[19:22] <helloimpulse> Mexico "oweing" money isn't what I meant by that
[19:22] <helloimpulse> That would be like me saying we "owe" china/Japan
[19:22] <themartyraion> Trump can get the best business minds in the world negotiating our foreign trade deals, and that's the way it should be. It should be crude, and it should be in our favor
[19:23] <saynsh> whats trumps policy on space travel?
[19:23] <themartyraion> i think he's cool with it lol
[19:23] <ipickflowers> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p6Nvc2aBhw PogChamp
[19:23] <helloimpulse> @Saynsh well he thinks global warming is a farce
[19:24] <memegotchi> "in our favor" meaning more expensive for consumers... and in return we get minimum wage factory jobs FeelsGoodMan
[19:24] <helloimpulse> But he thinks that companies like SpaceX are a good thing, and government shouldn't worry about it
[19:24] <saynsh> but will he build a wall around earth if we find evidence of life on mard?
[19:24] <saynsh> mars*
[19:24] <themartyraion> takes people off of wellfare and we pay lower taxes FeelsGoodMan
[19:24] <saynsh> just to be safe?
[19:24] <memegotchi> btw, did u know only 3% of consumer spending is on chinese goods?

[19:26] <konjkave> 6
[19:26] <saynsh> putin seems like an asshole
[19:26] <themartyraion> We don't have to befriend them
[19:26] <helloimpulse> I think that's the only reason we haven't worried about our relations with Russia.
[19:26] <themartyraion> we just don't have to be at eachother's throats
[19:26] <saynsh> i didnt like him on house of cards at all

[19:28] <saynsh> u have more in common with trump than you know
[19:29] <ivanventura01> what is hard about comprehension
[19:29] <themartyraion> Trump isn't intolerant. He's said nothing racist, is cool with gay rights
[19:29] <ivanventura01> nothing racist lmao
[19:29] <themartyraion> if a boy wants to be a girl I'm sure Trump is okay with that
[19:29] <ivanventura01> the guy is a walking contradiction
[19:29] <themartyraion> The guy is a walking winner
[19:29] <ivanventura01> he contradicted everything hes ever said
[19:29] <ivanventura01> the same guy that would be dating his daughter if she wasnt her daughter
[19:29] <ipickflowers> hey can you guys both type 9 because you are both retards

[19:31] <saynsh> like bush but on steroids
[19:31] <themartyraion> well they have to wait for a white guy to be president again

[19:33] <ivanventura01> go get some pussy
[19:33] <helloimpulse> Nice ad hominem
[19:33] <saynsh> this has nothing to do with politics
[19:33] <themartyraion> Obama didn't step in with a strong message in support of Ferguson police and basically justified the rioting when the police officer did his job
[19:33] <pacjax> tfw ivanventura01 is 5'7 80 pounds

[19:33] <ivanventura01> tfw thats not funny?

[19:34] <ivanventura01> you want pictures of me?
[19:34] <pacjax> yes.....
[19:34] <bestmanateena> I will never understand why Black Lives Matter focused on Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, rather than Eric Garner the guy who had video proof he got literally murdered
[19:34] <themartyraion> Racial tensions are worse under Obama than they ever were under Bush...kinda weird
[19:34] <ivanventura01> idiot lol
[19:34] <pacjax> yeah but only if their naked pics

[19:34] <pacjax> bestmanateena yeah true wtf
[19:35] <ivanventura01> as if thats not expected LOL
[19:35] <themartyraion> @BestManateeNa, because George Soros threw 33 million dollars at them and told them what to be angry about
[19:35] <pacjax> wow btfo trump supporters
[19:35] <bestmanateena> @Memegotchi, isn't actually pretty crazy how 99% of economics think free trade (without any caveats) is beneficial
[19:35] <bestmanateena> economists*
[19:35] <helloimpulse> Caveats such as tariffs?
[19:35] <ipickflowers> hey chat type 9 if you are a retard and you blend in on the internet so nobody notices
[19:35] <saynsh> ivan do u just wanna circlejerk?
[19:35] <ipickflowers> 9
[19:36] <bestmanateena> Well I mean trade deals like TPP

[19:36] <themartyraion> he's a crazy dude that George Soros. If BLM were protesting actual valid points then people would just agree with them and there would be no tension
[19:36] <saynsh> i can agree with everything u say if it makes you feel better about urself ivan
[19:36] <bestmanateena> a lot of economists think the trade side of the tpp is good, but then they have so much bad shit that has to do with surveilance /etc
[19:36] <pacjax> I'D RATHER DIE THAN WATCH THAT ipickflowers
[19:36] <pacjax> HE RUINS THE JOKE BY LAUGHING IMMEDIATELY WTF DansGame
[19:36] <bestmanateena> but tariffs by nature are protectionist
[19:37] <memegotchi> yeah TPP is loaded w/ shit unfortunately
[19:37] <ivanventura01> lol
[19:37] <helloimpulse> I'm not informed enough to debate the TPP deal. The only thing I've heard about it is the "hidden" stuff
[19:37] <pacjax> ipickflowers, dude
[19:37] <pacjax> I have tried jerking off to hentai at least 3 times in the past
[19:37] <bestmanateena> Yeah basically Free Trade is good except when it's bundled with other shit that has nothing to do with trade

[19:38] <saynsh> get a job
[19:38] <saynsh> get a haircut
[19:38] <bestmanateena> The reason why is because even though in a society as globalized as today where jobs can go overseas, in the end the consumer is getting a better deal that way. And while in the short term a job gets lost, more money flows into the economy
[19:38] <ivanventura01> im at work as we speak :]
[19:38] <saynsh> join the army
[19:38] <bestmanateena> The problem lies with when most of the money is going to the top 1%

[19:41] <ipickflowers> pacjax, etizolam
[19:41] <bestmanateena> Well I mean tha'ts fine but if you really want to convince people you have to make them think they came up with it
[19:41] <ipickflowers> pacjax, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etizolam SeemsGood
[19:42] <bestmanateena> And when you start insulting them it actually makes their convictions stronger
[19:42] <ipickflowers> i blacked out on this drug now i have a scar on my forehead LUL
[19:42] <bestmanateena> It's a really strange cognitive bias
[19:42] <helloimpulse> LMAO DRUGS
[19:42] <ipickflowers> i know SeemsGood
[19:42] <themartyraion> part of what I don't get about liberals is "We all just want to be treated equally. Now recognize all my differences that make me a unique special snowflake and you better treat me accordingly."
[19:42] <saynsh> martyr i identify as an apache attack helicopter, and as such should be allowed to mow you down with missile launchers or else youre oppressing me.
[19:43] <bestmanateena> @TheMartyrAion, what do you mean?
[19:43] <bestmanateena> Like can you clarify further with an example
[19:43] <themartyraion> I mean I feel like race is only still an issue because Liberals want to always remind everyone how different they are
[19:43] <saynsh> surely youre thinkin of tumblrtards martyr

[19:43] <bestmanateena> Yeah I mean the "uber tolerant" left wing is retarded, same with the extremist right
[19:44] <themartyraion> true
[19:44] <bestmanateena> tbh the truth generally seems to lie in the middle
[19:44] <saynsh> everything in moderation boyz
[19:44] <helloimpulse> Extremists are always retarded
[19:44] <saynsh> im moderately racist Kappa
[19:44] <themartyraion> that I can agree with
[19:44] <helloimpulse> From any group
[19:44] <helloimpulse> Except for mine Kappa
[19:44] <bestmanateena> A lot of economies in Europe are moving further right (which think would be like the liberal democratic side)
[19:45] <themartyraion> I'm a little racist. I get spurred on though by people constantly telling me to "check my privelege" like I don't earn everything I have in this life. Yeah I'm white but I'm one of 7 kids and I grew up poor as fuck
[19:45] <kappakingprime> there's even aspies talking economics in chat
[19:45] <kappakingprime> what have we become
[19:45] <kappakingprime> is this the end of humanity
[19:46] <ivanventura01> thats not what white privelege is
[19:46] <helloimpulse> And then there's an aspie complaingin about aspies talking about economics
[19:46] <themartyraion> I know what white privilege is Ivan
[19:46] <saynsh> are you mormon martyr
[19:46] <bestmanateena> @TheMartyrAion, you can get mad at those people, that's fair, especially if they tell you you can't hold opinion on matters just because you haven't experienced them
[19:46] <saynsh> or any other religion against contraception
[19:47] <ivanventura01> white privelege is getting pulled over by a cop for speeding and getting off while a black guy gets pulled over for the same thing then either gets beat up/car searched/tickets out the ass
[19:47] <bestmanateena> But @TheMartyrAion take a moment and read this, black people didn't own anything for 150 years and lost whatever semblance on culture they had back in Africa. When they were freed they had no money or properties at all, and for 100 years were still discriminated against economically/politically/socially.
[19:47] <helloimpulse> I actually don't believe that happens as much as people say it does
[19:47] <ivanventura01> while there are elements that effect that situation its just an example
[19:47] <kappakingprime> white privilege is getting discounts at walmart because you're skin doesn't look dirty
[19:47] <themartyraion> basically, if you're not white, then you always feel this imaginary oppression over you imposed by the crimes of whites in the past. You won't get a fair shot and any olive branch extended to you is motivated by something else.
[19:47] <saynsh> how can you check that though ivan, do you a cop to check it for you?
[19:48] <everyonelovesprime> fuck you guys

[19:48] <everyonelovesprime> can you all commit suicide
[19:48] <bestmanateena> But, that doesn't mean they should be given reparations which many people call for. What about native americans and japanese? It's too late. The best we can do is get better education out there
[19:48] <themartyraion> there's some demographics in this country that no matter how much of an opportunity you give them they'd rather just blame failures on systemic racism and stay in their situation
[19:48] <kappakingprime> autists debating racism and politics now be like
[19:48] <kappakingprime> http://i.imgur.com/AmTLXPO.gifv

[19:49] <themartyraion> I'm not mormon btw
[19:49] <everyonelovesprime> so those fuckers wouldnt be able to talk
[19:49] <saynsh> is there such a thing as black privilege then?
[19:49] <helloimpulse> LUL KAPPA SO FUNNY
[19:49] <ivanventura01> no lol
[19:49] <eh_polar_bear> black privilege is having chickens flee from you while you walk up to them
[19:49] <ivanventura01> in black communities sure youll get certain privs that a white man wouldnt
[19:49] <bestmanateena> @TheMartyrAion, Did you read what I said though? Just try to understand how comepletely fucked people were
[19:50] <ivanventura01> not that the white man would even care for them
[19:50] <themartyraion> no any black person that works hard and becomes successful is a sellout to the white man in some people's eyes
[19:50] <everyonelovesprime> the only black privilige is gettin shot
[19:50] <saynsh> then there is black privilege
[19:50] <themartyraion> Yeah I get it Best
[19:50] <themartyraion> but
[19:50] <ivanventura01> not in the same sense lol
[19:50] <themartyraion> I mean less than 1% of white people in America ever owned a slave
[19:50] <bestmanateena> I know dude i'm not saying
[19:50] <bestmanateena> you should feel guilty
[19:50] <themartyraion> and
[19:50] <bestmanateena> I'm saying understand why these things happened
[19:50] <helloimpulse> Black privilege is avoiding being confronted by road ragers
[19:50] <themartyraion> the word slave comes from Slavic

[19:51] <eh_polar_bear> 4ggPz warned ya
[19:51] <saynsh> ivan do you think black people can be racist? (hint: this is a retard test)
[19:51] <eh_polar_bear> yes
[19:51] <ivanventura01> anyone can be racist
[19:51] <eh_polar_bear> they're racist against watermelons
[19:51] <ivanventura01> wtf
[19:51] <saynsh> ok good
[19:51] <saynsh> then your not lost
[19:51] <helloimpulse> you're both lost
[19:51] <themartyraion> what my white privilege is to me is that if I fail at something then I don't think to blame anyone else or automatically think a system is out to screw me
[19:51] <bestmanateena> @TheMartyrAion, The problem is white ancestors who came to America were not enslaved when they were brought here, they owned houses/property and weren't discriminated against. Blacks didn't the chance until 1865, and even then they still had no money
[19:51] <ivanventura01> racism is just assuming your sruperiority over another race
[19:51] <saynsh> not if you ask the far left
[19:52] <eh_polar_bear> is this chat always like this when Destiny's not live DansGame
[19:52] <saynsh> sure, thats one way to define it
[19:52] <themartyraion> so I have the power to say "I failed because of me and I have to get better."
[19:52] <ivanventura01> thats not white privelege LOL
[19:52] <themartyraion> that's what it is to me Ivan
[19:52] <helloimpulse> It's twitch chat, it's like this all the time
[19:52] <ivanventura01> hahaha
[19:53] <bestmanateena> Stop talking about white privilege, that's the extremist left dude are you listening?
[19:53] <ipickflowers> eh_polar_bear, light blue 4Head / \ 4Head
[19:53] <bestmanateena> It's important to recognize that black people were fucked and no you shouldn't feel bad for it, but you also shouldn't ignore it
[19:54] <themartyraion> BestManateeNa that's what my perception of what others think my advantage is as a white person. They think that there is no one that wants to see me fail, hold me back or halt my progress
[19:54] <themartyraion> And I agree. But they have the same conditions now, but still don't feel it
[19:54] <bestmanateena> No they don't
[19:54] <bestmanateena> Let me paint you this picture
[19:55] <saynsh> it is a privilege to be born i civilized country with human rights, good healthcare and so on. its nothing to be proud of though.
[19:55] <memegotchi> KappaRoss
[19:55] <ivanventura01> l m a o
[19:55] <bestmanateena> In many, MANY places in the united states black people were sort of forced to move into the same neighborhoods
[19:55] <bestmanateena> people generally stay in the areas they were born
[19:55] <helloimpulse> @Saynsh Implying America has good healthcare LUL
[19:55] <kappakingprime> these shitters still going LUL
[19:56] <themartyraion> okay but Best....as a black person in America, if you don't let your environment drag you down and you work hard your options are infinite
[19:56] <memegotchi> he's trying to paint a picture u fucks DansGame
[19:56] <saynsh> tfw not amurican LUL
[19:56] <bestmanateena> during segregation the schools black people went to were notoriously underfunded and the teachers were bad
[19:56] <ivanventura01> this martyr guy LOL
[19:56] <helloimpulse> tfw debating American politics as a non-american LUL
[19:56] <ivanventura01> you really dont know what it means to grow up in that enviornment
[19:56] <themartyraion> it's true Ivan
[19:56] <bestmanateena> And also during segregation a process called redlining happened where banks refused to offer investment oppurtunities for black people
[19:56] <saynsh> im not though lol
[19:56] <ivanventura01> like at all
[19:56] <saynsh> i havent debated at all
[19:56] <ivanventura01> options are very limited in areas
[19:57] <bestmanateena> After segregation ends, black people still grow up in the same neighborhoods, same culture, and MAYBE a SLIGHTLY improved schooling system
[19:57] <ivanventura01> no where near infinite
[19:57] <saynsh> theres only shitposting and smacktalk coming from me
[19:57] <themartyraion> almost any company in America that has 2 options in front of them for a position and they are an equally qualified black person and white person, they will hire the black person
[19:57] <helloimpulse> It's racist if they don't Kappa
[19:57] <ivanventura01> youre talking about a simple job
[19:57] <themartyraion> even executive jobs
[19:57] <bestmanateena> Sigh
[19:57] <helloimpulse> Even college admission
[19:57] <ivanventura01> again
[19:57] <bestmanateena> Are you even reading what I'm saying dude
[19:58] <ivanventura01> not infinite
[19:58] <themartyraion> Best they have access to everything they need
[19:58] <ivanventura01> its called prejudice
[19:58] <destiny_bot> Destiny updates YouTube regularly now! "Destiny's Munchpak Snack Review" posted 4h 57m ago youtu.be/_p6Nvc2aBhw
[19:58] <bestmanateena> They don't.
[19:58] <themartyraion> they might have to take a bus to a local library
[19:58] <ivanventura01> martyr what kind of area do you live in?
[19:58] <ivanventura01> urban/suburban?
[19:58] <saynsh> can we remove libraries
[19:58] <themartyraion> Urban
[19:58] <saynsh> they do nothing
[19:59] <bestmanateena> They don't have the same education standards, familial standards, community standards, and cultural standards
[19:59] <saynsh> just google it pls
[19:59] <ivanventura01> im js growing up in a poor urban community will not give you the inifinte options you so claim
[19:59] <kappakingprime> nice conversation girls http://i.imgur.com/AmTLXPO.gifv
[19:59] <themartyraion> Ivan
[19:59] <bestmanateena> Would you say that poor whites have the same opportunities as rich whites? No. They don't. The average black person is worse off than whites, and many, many more black people are in poverty percentage wise.
[19:59] <ivanventura01> ex: school systems are fucked
[20:00] <saynsh> ivan havent you seen the wire? those kids got mad paper.
[20:00] <ivanventura01> the schools do not care about the students and receive no funding
[20:00] <ivanventura01> so scratch education off the list
[20:00] <saynsh> kappa stay jelly brah
[20:00] <themartyraion> I grew up poor as fuck man. 2nd oldest of 7 kids, wore hand me downs my entire life, never had a computer in my home until I was 16, almost all of our neighbors were illegal mexicans
[20:00] <themartyraion> I grew up in that exact environment you speak of
[20:01] <themartyraion> people shot eachother on my block all the time
[20:01] <bestmanateena> So how can you say you had the same opportunities as other people?
[20:01] <ivanventura01> so you understand your options arent infinite until you leave it
[20:01] <themartyraion> because
[20:01] <saynsh> martyr you had clothes?
[20:01] <saynsh> LUXURY
[20:01] <ivanventura01> and even them where you comes from follows you for the rest of your life
[20:01] <ivanventura01> and that will come with prejudice
[20:02] <ivanventura01> then*
[20:02] <themartyraion> I wound up in gifted programs in school, wound up scoring 29 on my ACT, got a college degree, have a career
[20:02] <bestmanateena> So because you did it everyone can right?
[20:02] <themartyraion> everyone is capable
[20:02] <ivanventura01> youre a smart guy congratulations
[20:02] <saynsh> dat white privilege paid for itself
[20:02] <bestmanateena> And what about the people in your neighborhood
[20:02] <themartyraion> No I'm still paying out my ass for student loans >.<
[20:02] <ivanventura01> not everyone is
[20:02] <saynsh> lol
[20:02] <bestmanateena> did they grow up to score a 29 on the ACT and get a career?
[20:03] <ivanventura01> not everyone can follow the same path you did
[20:03] <ivanventura01> its called life
[20:03] <ivanventura01> its different for everyone
[20:03] <saynsh> yeah, its tough
[20:03] <ivanventura01> just because you managed doesnt mean everyone will or can
[20:03] <saynsh> so suck it up
[20:03] <themartyraion> Not all of them made anything of themselves. A lot of that was personal choice and sacrifice
[20:03] <ivanventura01> not always
[20:03] <saynsh> survival.of the fittest and all that jazz
[20:04] <themartyraion> SAYNsh so what you're basically saying is "Life's a dick, sometimes you just gotta suck it up as it comes" Kappa
[20:04] <saynsh> sorry that was my thin privilege speaking
[20:04] <saynsh> surcival of the body positivest
[20:04] <ivanventura01> i dont understand ur username
[20:05] <ivanventura01> is that like
[20:05] <ivanventura01> ur name
[20:05] <dicedlemming> evolutionary psychology is not a real thing
[20:05] <memegotchi> PogChamp
[20:05] <ivanventura01> saynsh
[20:05] <saynsh> hmmm?
[20:05] <dicedlemming> you cant use survival of the fittest as a way to explain how a human acts
[20:05] <ivanventura01> i dont think thats what he meant
[20:05] <saynsh> im not talking to you diced you autist
[20:06] <saynsh> jesus christ
[20:06] <dicedlemming> BabyRage i said something stupid you're autistic BabyRage
[20:06] <saynsh> this is not a serious discussion
[20:06] <ivanventura01> autism has really become the choice word huh lol
[20:06] <saynsh> goofs and gafs
[20:06] <bestmanateena> How conversations start if no one was talking to anyone in the beginning?
[20:06] <saynsh> dont be such an aspie diced
[20:06] <themartyraion> but BestManateeNA what I can say is I never felt disadvantaged growing up in that environment and always felt like if I failed it would be because of me, not because of where I'm from and what my parents make
[20:07] <saynsh> ivan you wanted something?
[20:07] <ivanventura01> put that in your auto biography
[20:07] <ivanventura01> cus thats the onlyplace where it belongs
[20:07] <ivanventura01> i was asking about your name
[20:07] <bestmanateena> You need to empathize dude
[20:07] <ivanventura01> username
[20:07] <saynsh> oh its from a book
[20:08] <saynsh> Sayn Shanda is a character
[20:08] <potioncellar> twitch chat is still going strong! PogChamp
[20:08] <bestmanateena> If you really did come from that situation and you can't understand why someone would be disadvantaged because of it than I guess you need more experience
[20:08] <destiny_bot> Destiny has a new Twitter! twitter.com/OmniDestiny
[20:08] <ivanventura01> i see
[20:08] <saynsh> ye not exciting

[20:09] <ivanventura01> bestmanatee summed it up
[20:09] <ivanventura01> more like perspective tho
[20:10] <ivanventura01> rather than experience
[20:10] <bestmanateena> @Memegotchi, where are you
[20:12] <themartyraion> I do empathize. But my part of my empathy is that I'm not being told by people raising me that the system is out to get me and the white man will do whatever he can to keep me down. Even if that isn't real if you put that in someone's head enough they'll start thinking it's the truth and then what? They don't work to improve because they don't believe their failure has anything to do with themselves
[20:12] <saynsh> so should we start a movement to end womens suffrage now or what?
[20:12] <saynsh> i think theyve suffered enough
[20:12] <ivanventura01> lol
[20:12] <ivanventura01> sayn is cool
[20:12] <bestmanateena> sigh. Obviously that happens, I never said it didn't. That doesn't mean black people aren't and haven't been disadvantaged.
[20:13] <ivanventura01> we would be friends under different circumstances
[20:13] <ivanventura01> much troll
[20:13] <saynsh> lel
[20:13] <saynsh> but seriously
[20:13] <saynsh> hopes and dreams are just satans way of keeping women out of the kitchen
[20:15] <saynsh> did I mention I browse /r/redpill?
[20:15] <ivanventura01> reddit is for losers
[20:15] <ivanventura01> unless you play league
[20:15] <themartyraion> Man but the Bernie stuff is GOLD on reddit
[20:15] <ivanventura01> ;]
[20:15] <ivanventura01> the bernie and hilary comparison memes get me everytime
[20:15] <themartyraion> Bernie supporters get SOOO RACIST everytime Hillary wins a state
[20:16] <themartyraion> "how are blacks so stupid that they vote against their own interests?"
[20:16] <ivanventura01> theres better ways to word that
[20:16] <themartyraion> that's how reddit words it
[20:16] <themartyraion> not me
[20:16] <ivanventura01> but that is the most racist way to do it LOL
[20:16] <themartyraion> IDGAF about bernie
[20:16] <saynsh> that hillary agrees with sanders video is gold
[20:16] <ivanventura01> i know im agreeing
[20:17] <pacjax> evolutionary psychology ISN'T REAL? EleGiggle
[20:17] <themartyraion> Ben Carson had a good quote about white liberals I have to find it
[20:17] <pacjax> LUL
[20:17] <pacjax> SCIENCE ISN'T REAL EleGiggle
[20:17] <ivanventura01> the colbert report where shows trump contradicting himself side by side is hilarios as well
[20:17] <saynsh> pacjax woke up
[20:17] <iamscarzi> pacjax HeyGuys
[20:18] <pacjax> HeyGuys
[20:18] <saynsh> is the new colbert show still his character
[20:18] <themartyraion> “They’re the most racist people there are because they put you in a little category, a box,” Dr. Carson said. “How could you dare come off the plantation?”
[20:18] <saynsh> or is he himself
[20:18] <ivanventura01> not sure just saw a clip of it on facebook i dont watch tv particularly
[20:18] <destiny_bot> Robot Lady will read your message for $5 or more donations twitchalerts.com/donate/destiny
[20:18] <saynsh> ah k
[20:18] <ivanventura01> too much of a gamer
[20:18] <ivanventura01> and tv doesnt have ad blocker
[20:18] <saynsh> le nerd xDDD
[20:18] <ivanventura01> :[
[20:18] <themartyraion> Ivan Trump the business man had different motives and motivations than Trump the presidential candidate
[20:19] <ivanventura01> but he is the same person
[20:19] <themartyraion> business people grease the palms they need to grease, play nice with who they need to play nice with
[20:19] <ivanventura01> its not just about ppl either
[20:19] <saynsh> yeah thats totally different from poloticians martyr LMAO
[20:19] <ivanventura01> and you can say that about any presidential candidate ever
[20:20] <ivanventura01> ppl will say anything to be president
[20:20] <themartyraion> he's not taking anyone's money other than unsolicited contributions for his campaign
[20:20] <ivanventura01> bernie wants to lift the federal ban on weed but knows he cant do that without congress
[20:20] <ivanventura01> and congress is filled with republicans
[20:20] <themartyraion> but I guess my point is he was speaking from a position of a business person exploiting the system in the past
[20:20] <ivanventura01> but he said it anyway
[20:20] <ivanventura01> cus he knows what ppl want
[20:21] <themartyraion> now he's speaking from a position of a presidential candidate
[20:21] <ivanventura01> and then what youre speaking of
[20:21] <themartyraion> it's way different
[20:21] <ivanventura01> correlates
[20:21] <ivanventura01> cus trump will say anything as well
[20:21] <themartyraion> right but that's why there's contradictions
[20:21] <saynsh> i think we can all agree that if trump wins, it'll be hilarious in one way or another
[20:21] <ivanventura01> i dont think it will be
[20:22] <ivanventura01> id rather have a 3rd grader as president tbh
[20:22] <saynsh> nah
[20:22] <themartyraion> Trump's IQ is in like the 150's man
[20:22] <ivanventura01> IN WAHT WORLD
[20:22] <ivanventura01> LMFAO
[20:22] <themartyraion> in this world
[20:22] <themartyraion> for real
[20:22] <themartyraion> dead serious
[20:22] <ivanventura01> thats when i leave this chat
[20:22] <saynsh> FUCK OFF WITH IQ pls
[20:22] <ivanventura01> pce ppl
[20:23] <themartyraion> I'm just saying
[20:23] <saynsh> how does IQ help be a leader
[20:23] <saynsh> it doesnt
[20:23] <saynsh> you be an autistic asshole and have high iq
[20:23] <pacjax> LIBERTARIANISM IS THE ULTIMATE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING
[20:23] <pacjax> EVERYONE ELSE SHOULD DIE
[20:23] <saynsh> pls dont trigger me
[20:23] <themartyraion> it doesn't, I'm just saying it's considerably different than George W.
[20:23] <saynsh> oh yeah
[20:23] <saynsh> definitely
[20:24] <pacjax> I walked in on somebody getting mad as fuck EleGiggle
[20:24] <pacjax> who is it tho? bUrself
[20:24] <ivanventura01> trump is a celebrity business man running for president
[20:24] <saynsh> the hilarity from trump would come from his crass and crazy persona
[20:24] <ivanventura01> nothing more nothing less
[20:24] <saynsh> not his inability to read
[20:24] <themartyraion> and Hillary is just the wife of a former president
[20:24] <ivanventura01> if he didnt have that stupid tv show he would be selling watches in ny
[20:24] <ivanventura01> but at least she has experience
[20:24] <themartyraion> she used to do the dishes in the White House
[20:24] <ivanventura01> in the white house
[20:24] <ivanventura01> and politics

[20:37] <ivanventura01> if they find it of course
[20:37] <themartyraion> as fricken liberal as my state is we can open carry and you just have to take like a 6 hour class for CCL

[20:38] <destiny_bot> Destiny updates YouTube regularly now! "Destiny's Munchpak Snack Review" posted 5h 37m ago youtu.be/_p6Nvc2aBhw
[20:38] <themartyraion> but to protect you gotta be accessible
[20:38] <ivanventura01> or put it somewhere you know as a responsible adult your kids will never reach it
[20:38] <themartyraion> and if it's accessible kids can find it
[20:38] <themartyraion> yeah
[20:38] <ivanventura01> or even
[20:39] <ivanventura01> the smarter idea
[20:39] <ivanventura01> educate them
[20:39] <ivanventura01> about guns/the laws and what not
[20:39] <ivanventura01> being a parent is fun
[20:39] <destiny_bot> Let someone else talk; 10m
[20:39] <saynsh> ill be honest, guns scare the fuck out of me, ive seen enough gifs of negligence. im glad we dont have guns in my country. but i feel like its kinda stupid to allow guns but only if you keep them as a glorified hobby instead of self defense

[21:50] <eh_polar_bear> I loved that game

[21:50] <mar45690> @eh_polar_bear, it lasted for like a month LUL
[21:50] <eh_polar_bear> i know LUL
[21:50] <eh_polar_bear> but still, the gameplay was really fun imo
[21:50] <randocchi> dae remember dawngate nathanDank
[21:50] <crigget> Titanfall was a good idea

[21:50] <crigget> Dawngate LUL
[21:51] <eh_polar_bear> I look forward to it
[21:51] <mar45690> @eh_polar_bear, hopefully it doesn't follow SC 2 routes where they lost a lot of the fan base EleGiggle
[21:51] <feedbackgaming> 2 full clips to kill 1 guy, steel skin
[21:51] <crigget> My brother had 2 accounts in top 20 on the ladder LUL
[21:51] <eh_polar_bear> the technical aspects of Titanfalls gameplay were really really good
[21:51] <eh_polar_bear> it separated the good and the PogChamp players well
[21:51] <mar45690> @eh_polar_bear, but it died off
[21:51] <zervaldo> ResidentSleeper
[21:51] <eh_polar_bear> mar45690, BibleThump
[21:51] <mar45690> I heard the gameplay got really repetitive
[21:51] <derpetronicsfacility> @crigget was that a moba?
[21:51] <mar45690> or the mech part was boring
[21:51] <sightbain> nah it was really good
[21:52] <crigget> DerpetronicsFacility, yeah
[21:52] <eh_polar_bear> not really
[21:52] <eh_polar_bear> against good players it can get intense
[21:52] <mar45690> wait then why the fuck did it die?
[21:52] <crigget> Dawngate was actually quite fun, unique ideas
[21:52] <mar45690> what did cs:go kill it
[21:52] <derpetronicsfacility> I miss the interactive VHS board games of the 90s FeelsBadMan
[21:52] <eh_polar_bear> and scrub farming in pubs is really fun in Titanfall too
[21:52] <crigget> titanfall died because of map packs and shit
[21:52] <mar45690> oh
[21:52] <mar45690> so too little content in the beginning?
[21:53] <sightbain> ya it suffered a bit
[21:53] <crigget> Yeah kinda
[21:53] <mar45690> but at least Titan Fall lasted for a month
[21:53] <eh_polar_bear> Crigget, I'd argue it's because of how poorly they handled the matchmaking and pvp aspects
[21:53] <curtsy> Titanfall died because of titanfall. It was dead the week it came out being realistic.
[21:53] <crigget> A lot of stuff went bad in titanfall

[22:57] <eh_polar_bear> its called "gl flanking in this game:
[22:58] <itsmurda> this game doesn't really feel like an MMO
[22:58] <derpetronicsfacility> is this like the good old days of warfare where men were men and just stood in a line and shot at each other? PogChamp
[22:58] <eh_polar_bear> that's because its an RPG
[22:58] <perfectskye> It's an FPS with MMO mechanics, like Destiny.
[22:58] <itsmurda> looks like a single player shooter with co-op
[22:58] <perfectskye> And yes, RPG elements.
[22:58] <eh_polar_bear> no, its an RTS

[23:24] <savant7> @Rysst so if he does 5 runs in an hour and saved a minute he gets back 4 mins back and do it in 56 minutes instead of 1hr? idk
[23:24] <zervaldo> ... i'm not
[23:25] <derpetronicsfacility> @zervaldo not you specifically, the general you
[23:25] <zervaldo> don't ask me. i don't see the appeal in this game..
[23:25] <zervaldo> it reminds me of guild wars 2 for some reason
[23:25] <eh_polar_bear> It reminds me of Gears of War
[23:25] <eh_polar_bear> becaus its a TPS FeelsBadMan
[23:26] <derpetronicsfacility> I think guild wars 2 can be fun depending on your interests
[23:26] <derpetronicsfacility> I abhor hardcore grinding
[23:26] <rysst> Savant why would you do it slower if you can do it faster
[23:26] <zomgitzmig> FeelsBadMan
[23:26] <zervaldo> it's already old
[23:26] <derpetronicsfacility> @rysst do you fast forward all movies and shows? Kappa
[23:26] <savant7> it's like shaving 1/13th off the time isnt a huge deal, if it was a 3 minute mission they were getting down to 2 minutes thats 1/3rd off the time so yo actually get a singinficant increase
[23:26] <americangundam> wow so beta steven
[23:26] <rysst> Derpetronicsfacility If they're as boring as The Division I do
[23:26] <americangundam> i been playing solo
[23:27] <falconsbane> can you matchmake challenge mode?
[23:27] <americangundam> ripping newbs
[23:27] <derpetronicsfacility> @rysst I usually go for the power button in those situations
[23:27] <americangundam> carrying challanger
[23:27] <americangundam> ez
[23:27] <rysst> Savant7 a few minutes is a few minutes
[23:27] <esoterikk> can you match make challenge modes?
[23:28] <americangundam> yeah man
[23:28] <rysst> Who cares if it's only 1/13th off the time
[23:28] <americangundam> it's all i do
[23:28] <raginspam> lol
[23:28] <derpetronicsfacility> !momolewds
[23:28] <zodsnafu> !song
[23:28] <destiny_bot> No song played/scrobbled. Played 6m ago: Waves - Kanye West
[23:28] <savant7> i dont think it really massively matters 55 mins vs 60 mins if it was enough for them to get in another full run in an hour it'd be worth it, but atm I feel like they are doing it fast enough, w/e
[23:28] <destiny_bot> Destiny has a new Twitter! twitter.com/OmniDestiny
[23:28] <mom0momo> care to try our new command !momololis ?
[23:28] <eh_polar_bear> no
[23:29] <americangundam> you can do lexington in 15-20
[23:29] <americangundam> when rolling deep
[23:29] <americangundam> i have done it a few times with pickups
[23:29] <americangundam> ffs
[23:29] <rysst> But Savant7 why would they not try to do it faster, what do they stand to gain from just autopiloting the missions instead of having fun trying to beat their time
[23:29] <rysst> It's just an argument I don't understand
[23:30] <mom0momo> Hey guys
[23:30] <americangundam> its mostly the nade stack.
[23:30] <derpetronicsfacility> @rysst some people go for optimizing and others are ok with something "satisfactory" - that appears to be the difference here
[23:30] <americangundam> the rest of it is smooth
[23:30] <esoterikk> I think they are trying to get gear
[23:30] <mom0momo> Has anyone here seen "The Big Short"?
[23:30] <headsorfails> a little?
[23:30] <esoterikk> so they are doing the easy/quick way
[23:30] <headsorfails> :P
[23:30] <savant7> I just feel like he's trying to set an arbitrary goal, w/e Destiny doing whatever he can to try to make this game interesting to watch ;)
[23:30] <derpetronicsfacility> @MoM0MoMo, I do when I look in my pants FeelsBadMan
[23:30] <rysst> All goals in video games are pretty arbitrary
[23:31] <americangundam> yeah
[23:31] <savant7> Wahey nihilist memes
[23:31] <americangundam> farm yellow talents on items
[23:31] <americangundam> then waste money
[23:31] <savant7> actually there are some pretty funny nilhist memes
[23:31] <zenixrevenge> well lol remember the EVE streams?
[23:31] <americangundam> yeah
[23:32] <americangundam> the scope rolls the worst
[23:32] <americangundam> the rest of them are all DPS increases
[23:32] <americangundam> even with shit rolls
[23:32] <ipickflowers> hey light blue guy 4Head /
[23:32] <ipickflowers> 4Head / \ 4Head
[23:33] <derpetronicsfacility> wait donald trump was actually in wwe? that wasn't a joke?
[23:33] <eh_polar_bear> hi
[23:33] <derpetronicsfacility> wtf
[23:33] <peteblunts> yeah he was
[23:33] <peteblunts> not in but appeared in it
[23:33] <rysst> Reagan, the best president we ever had Kappa
[23:33] <viralinstincts> @Derpetronicsfacility it was a storyline to where he almost owned wwe
[23:33] <thejohnnyb92> How did you get that cabescus or how ever you say it
[23:34] <derpetronicsfacility> @viralinstincts, do the fans know it's mostly a soap opera? I can never tell
[23:34] <bulldog_2019> ^^^^^^
[23:34] <savant7> My friend loves wrestling but he's the first to admit it's a soap opera but because its so over the top and silly is why he enjoys it :P
[23:35] <americangundam> your old bitch
[23:35] <americangundam> stone cold is a hero
[23:35] <curtsy> I'm very sure the fans know it's all a show, usually when a wrestler retires they go on stage and talk for a bit clearly out of character, this has been a thing for decades.
[23:35] <rysst> Savant7 I don't think that anybody believes that it's real
[23:35] <americangundam> a true gem
[23:35] <bulldog_2019> asking about the cadaceus plz tell me hw you got it
[23:35] <americangundam> le your
[23:35] <derpetronicsfacility> I only remember "friends" of mine arguing over whether wrestling was real in elementary school FeelsBadMan
[23:36] <zervaldo> 20%?
[23:36] <savant7> there is that dude that does the extreme fishing show with the giant beard who is also a wrestler
[23:36] <derpetronicsfacility> and the average american can't outwit a head of broccoli, so....
[23:36] <mom0momo> hey guys
[23:36] <americangundam> generalizing makes your fit in
[23:36] <thxmanny> like a boss
[23:36] <mom0momo> % chance of bernie sanders winning?
[23:36] <americangundam> Europeans are so skilled at it
[23:36] <thxmanny> is there a number less than zero?
[23:36] <americangundam> don't rock the boat
[23:37] <derpetronicsfacility> @MoM0MoMo, -5% FeelsBadMan
[23:37] <americangundam> have a spot of tea
[23:37] <americangundam> fuck a child
[23:37] <americangundam> you know...
[23:37] <derpetronicsfacility> WutFace
[23:37] <viralinstincts> @Derpetronicsfacility some things we will never know because some things isnt read from a script like cmpunks and chris jerichos rants or even the wrestlers personal lives are even kept out of wwe they have alot of peoples personal things in it now
[23:37] <bulldog_2019> yep because you always hear about europeans being great wrestlers:)
[23:37] <zervaldo> FINALLY
[23:37] <savant7> BERNIE WINNING CHANCE 1000% AngelThump FEEL THE BERN BibleThump rip the dream...
[23:38] <proposal_> So its The Division Basically like borderlands?
[23:38] <derpetronicsfacility> minus the humor
[23:38] <curtsy> @Proposal_, Sort of not really
[23:38] <curtsy> It's more like Destiny
[23:38] <proposal_> with a World PvP aspecty?
[23:38] <bulldog_2019> nah its more like destiny in new york bu they did everything tht destiny did wrong right
[23:38] <curtsy> There is no world pvp
[23:38] <destiny_bot> Robot Lady will read your message for $5 or more donations twitchalerts.com/donate/destiny
[23:38] <curtsy> It's instanced
[23:38] <reallancegunnin> lol
[23:38] <falconsbane> lol wtf
[23:38] <proposal_> ah ok
[23:39] <proposal_> how many ppl in the open world pvp thing at once
[23:39] <savant7> FF Tactics plz you're not xcom
[23:39] <zervaldo> change the jacket destiny aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[23:39] <proposal_> its not just 4v4 right
[23:39] <curtsy> Currently there is also no actual incentive to pvp
[23:39] <proposal_> how similar is it to dayz
[23:39] <reallancegunnin> final fantasy tactics is so easy for me now but thats after 500+ hours easily
[23:39] <v0rdhosbn> worth crafting a gold socom snipe?
[23:39] <curtsy> It's a zone with a cap of like 24 people, has PvE objectives in it but you can kill people.
[23:39] <falconsbane> reforging
[23:39] <reallancegunnin> in the playstation version you can glitch out some of the classes to unlock all the skills for that class too. its pretty broken
[23:39] <proposal_> so the zone pvp thing is sortttta like dayz
[23:40] <curtsy> Sort of not really
[23:40] <derpetronicsfacility> @curtsy sounds like the crew with its 8 population cap per instance LUL
[23:40] <curtsy> You attack someone and you go rogue, which is like being flagged in WoW
[23:40] <savant7> jacket memes
[23:40] <viralinstincts> trump knows how to bring the finance and business of the country and bernie knows how to bring the freedom and public outroars to light
[23:40] <zervaldo> now he's got some tight ass jeans on
[23:41] <curtsy> Then people see your location and can and will come and kill you and gain rewards far exceeding the rewards you got for going rogue in the first placd
[23:41] <derpetronicsfacility> Trump X Bernie
[23:41] <curtsy> place*
[23:41] <derpetronicsfacility> that would be one lemon party I'd like to see Kappa
[23:41] <mom0momo> Alright boys
[23:41] <savant7> really I feel like Trump would just completely fuck all international trade relationships
[23:41] <mom0momo> name a country with a high unemployment rate

[00:31] <eh_polar_bear> I promise I won't again
[00:31] <savant7> I've been injecting too many memes into my bloodstream to the point where I read an article from New Scientist called "Dark Money Sponsors Climate Change Denial in the White House" as "Dank Money...." It said 600 million is paid out in secret and I thought "wow yeah that is pretty dank money", has the term dank become really that universally used? Keepo
[00:31] <zervaldo> fool me once
[00:31] <eh_polar_bear> no fool
[00:31] <eh_polar_bear> nathanRuse
[00:31] <cute_sc2> Why dont they just change the setting of the game to like airsoft wars or something
[00:31] <deceive_> What is he's main gun
[00:31] <cute_sc2> it would be more believable
[00:31] <cute_sc2> shooting someone with 100 airsoft pellets
[00:31] <cute_sc2> to kill them
[00:31] <zervaldo> hahahaha
[00:31] <eh_polar_bear> Cute_Sc2, LUL right
[00:31] <babydrool> Are they speedrunning now?
[00:31] <zervaldo> makes more sense indeed
[00:31] <babydrool> Have we gone full autism?
[00:32] <eh_polar_bear> they've passed the threshold of full autism long ago
[00:32] <deceive_> Why don't anyone reply in this stream?
[00:32] <eh_polar_bear> they are setting the autism bar rn
[00:32] <savant7> airsoft memes
[00:32] <zervaldo> Deceive_ too busy being autistic
[00:33] <jmaaaaaaaaaan> is destiny one of the streamers getting paid by ubisoft to stream this game
[00:33] <savant7> Destiny's main weapon, BB gun replica M16 Keepo
[00:33] <deceive_> So what should be the first thing I do once I hit level 30?
[00:33] <zervaldo> KYS
[00:34] <zervaldo> or grind challenge missions/DZ..
[00:34] <zervaldo> first option is better tho
[00:34] <deceive_> I'd rather kms
[00:34] <deceive_> Does this guy ever read chat
[00:34] <eh_polar_bear> Deceive_, sometimes
[00:34] <zervaldo> twitch chat very rarely.
[00:34] <eh_polar_bear> he isnt much of a chat replyer
[00:35] <savant7> he is busy tryharding
[00:35] <curtsy> He does, but most of hsi attention is focused on his website
[00:35] <deceive_> Da fuq is the point of streaming then lol
[00:35] <jmaaaaaaaaaan> he reads it but doesnt respond. Destiny is too advanced for us humans
[00:35] <zervaldo> ask him with a 5$ donation PEPE
[00:35] <cute_sc2> that 1 only took 50 bullets to the face
[00:35] <curtsy> Because 95% of people watch him via his site
[00:35] <eh_polar_bear> Deceive_, go to his website if you want your ego stroked
[00:35] <deceive_> Rather not
[00:35] <cute_sc2> of a sub machine gun
[00:35] <cute_sc2> at point blank range
[00:35] <cute_sc2> to his face
[00:35] <eh_polar_bear> then why are you bitching LUL
[00:35] <cute_sc2> his human face
[00:36] <eh_polar_bear> Cute_Sc2, stop complaining about realism when you play sc2
[00:36] <azteckniight> sorry fairly new here but, does destiny read stream from this chat or his website
[00:36] <eh_polar_bear> just saying, why can't a CC land on a zergling Kappa
[00:36] <jmaaaaaaaaaan> both
[00:36] <deceive_> Who's bitching? It's my first time in this stream just wondering why he doesn't read chat
[00:36] <eh_polar_bear> AztecKniight, mostly his website
[00:36] <omatherius> Azteckniight both but he rarely replies
[00:36] <babydrool> His website. Just don't say anything controversial or you'll get the banhammer
[00:36] <cute_sc2> but most of the things in this game are realistic except for that lol @eh_polar_bear
[00:36] <savant7> @eh_polar_bear at least marines fucking die when they get shelled by 2 tank shots Keepo
[00:36] <cute_sc2> thats not the same as a game thats fantasy
[00:36] <eh_polar_bear> Deceive_, you're too used to being acknowledged then.
[00:36] <jmaaaaaaaaaan> the memes are stronger on his website chat, so he focuses most of his attention there
[00:36] <azteckniight> Yea, because ive noticed the chat on the screen is different than this one
[00:37] <eh_polar_bear> Savant7, they should die from one tank shell, its a tank Kappa

[00:37] <deceive_> @eh_polar_bear nope, just used to going into a stream where they read chat, ya know? The whole point of streaming
[00:37] <cute_sc2> I' not complaining eh_polar_bear I'm just making memes Kappa
[00:37] <sightbain> the point of streaming is to read chat DansGame

[00:38] <cute_sc2> Kinda like i like to hear myself talk in rl
[00:38] <savant7> it's not the whole point of streaming just to hear senpai answer your questions you are all together watching quality gameplay making polite dinner party conversation memes Keepo
[00:38] <eh_polar_bear> you can come interact with him when he's not tryharding and doing a political discussion or something
[00:38] <destiny_bot> Destiny updates YouTube regularly now! "Destiny's Munchpak Snack Review" posted 9h 38m ago youtu.be/_p6Nvc2aBhw
[00:38] <renegadefunk> X
[00:38] <cute_sc2> how *
[00:39] <eh_polar_bear> its more fun that way Kappa
[00:39] <cute_sc2> FeelsGoodMan @zervaldo
[00:39] <zervaldo> Cute_sc2 Me too.. and especially putting an unnecessary @ in front of names too Kappa
[00:39] <sightbain> Well Destiny learned from cohh that he can rip off his subs by making his own website Kappa, guess he forgot to spend his entire stream insincerely thanking chat
[00:39] <jmaaaaaaaaaan> wtf am i watching, theyre shooting entire magazines at a guy and he doesnt die?
[00:39] <cute_sc2> It fills in the persons namefor you if you put @ @zervaldo
[00:39] <cute_sc2> so i have to type less than you do
[00:39] <zervaldo> Cute_sc2 so your name isnt filled?
[00:39] <babydrool> @Jmaaaaaaaaaan Y-y-y-y-you have to suspend your disbelief!!!!!!!
[00:39] <killer346> voice crack
[00:39] <eh_polar_bear> Cute_Sc2, is this game marine vs ultralisk simulator Kappa
[00:39] <cute_sc2> LUL eh_polar_bear
[00:40] <curtsy> @jmaaaaaaaaaan, Yes, this is a third person shooter rpg, welcome to the game.
[00:40] <cute_sc2> Nice mem
[00:40] <cute_sc2> polar_bear
[00:40] <eh_polar_bear> third person shooter still sounds so retarded imo
[00:40] <jmaaaaaaaaaan> but ive seen other people play this game, and it doesnt take 2 magazines to kill a person
[00:40] <curtsy> They are fighting NPC's
[00:40] <babydrool> Earlier levels dawg
[00:40] <jmaaaaaaaaaan> oic
[00:40] <reallancegunnin> they probably get more defensive mechanics at higher levels
[00:40] <jmaaaaaaaaaan> well, fuck this game even more then
[00:40] <deceive_> This is challenge mode, you can't call so,etching challenge mode and expect to 1 shot them
[00:40] <deceive_> Something
[00:41] <zervaldo> they're all using .01 ammo, don't be too harsh on them
[00:41] <reallancegunnin> firing blanks Kappa
[00:41] <eh_polar_bear> I swear these enemy soldiers weights have to have increased by like 2x by the time they die from all the bullets they've eaten
[00:41] <savant7> bb gun and airsoft memes
[00:41] <babydrool> If this game explained just a little bit as to why they're so tanky I would be satisfied. Like the terrorist organization stole this amazing body armor from the military during the viral outbreak.
[00:41] <jmaaaaaaaaaan> csgo >>>>>> goldfish feces >>>> the division
[00:41] <eh_polar_bear> I don't really think you can compare the two
[00:42] <perfectskye> Think of it like this: Every bullet before the killing blow is rubber.
[00:42] <jmaaaaaaaaaan> of course you can
[00:42] <csmoove24> Facts
[00:42] <jmaaaaaaaaaan> theyre shooter games
[00:42] <reallancegunnin> Shark feces > csgo > goldfish feces > the division Kappa b
[00:42] <eh_polar_bear> CSGO is straight PvP oriented
[00:42] <eh_polar_bear> this is more like.... Ruenscape with guns
[00:42] <csmoove24> Csgo is a competitive game
[00:42] <warman525> Anyone know how to get the Midas?
[00:42] <sightbain> half life > the division
[00:42] <sightbain> both shooters but only one o them is good
[00:42] <warman525> I want one so bad :/
[00:43] <csmoove24> Call of duty>>>>>> csgo
[00:43] <eh_polar_bear> LUL

[00:43] <eh_polar_bear> dude, what's your herblore level in the division Kappa
[00:43] <cute_sc2> LOL harvest moon waifu in the division
[00:43] <jmaaaaaaaaaan> either way, my point is that the division looks like a shit game, perhaps enjoyable for a couple days
[00:43] <perfectskye> For you.
[00:43] <zervaldo> i wish there was a worthwhile mmo to play right now
[00:43] <cute_sc2> Sounds like a good DLC to me Keepo
[00:43] <savant7> You could get a waifu in MapleStory Keepo
[00:44] <zervaldo> black desert looked cool but in the end its just another shitfest
[00:44] <jmaaaaaaaaaan> like, if people are still playing this game after a month, i would be surprised
[00:44] <curtsy> The game Destiny looks the same way, and people are still playing that shit two years later
[00:44] <jmaaaaaaaaaan> gonna be another battlefront
[00:44] <reallancegunnin> people still play destiny
[00:44] <savant7> it's pretty much like destiny
[00:44] <jmaaaaaaaaaan> battlefront fell off the face of the planet
[00:44] <reallancegunnin> but this game isnt like battlefront
[00:44] <zervaldo> Jmaaaaaaaaaan i think the userbase will drop by 60% in a month.. quote me on it
[00:44] <eh_polar_bear> Curtsy, Destiny\s developers have put somewhat of an effort to support their base, and the PvP in that game is half decent
[00:45] <eh_polar_bear> Battlefront LUL
[00:45] <eh_polar_bear> I forgot that game existed until now
[00:45] <curtsy> @eh_polar_bear, Yeah half decent pvp that doesn't have custom matches LUL
[00:45] <nikrado> basically all high profile streamers will never play this game again by the end of march
[00:45] <babydrool> I don't know if ubisoft can really make the same commitment
[00:45] <mar45690> @eh_polar_bear LUL died in the first day
[00:45] <savant7> but black people are meme thieves Keepo
[00:45] <eh_polar_bear> Curtsy, listen, half decent is half indecent
[00:45] <eh_polar_bear> cmonBruh
[00:45] <curtsy> Took them a year to put in voice comm in pvp LUL
[00:45] <shammasterj> It's over time
[00:45] <shammasterj> short time
[00:45] <mar45690> @eh_polar_bear but didn't die as fast as halo five or master chief LUL
[00:46] <eh_polar_bear> tbh I'm fine without voice in PvP online
[00:46] <zervaldo> we're all waiting for dark souls 3 anyway, pepe
[00:46] <cute_sc2> Black people don't know how to use computers Savant7
[00:46] <eh_polar_bear> if I'm playing pvp I usually roll with friends with a third party chat system
[00:46] <cute_sc2> How can they be meme thieves
[00:46] <eh_polar_bear> like in Splatoon
[00:46] <eh_polar_bear> memes are universal
[00:46] <curtsy> It's not the point that you're fine without it, it's the fact that they're skipping out on features that have been in online shooters since 1997
[00:46] <cute_sc2> Kappa racism
[00:47] <eh_polar_bear> Curtsy, I wanna say they left it out on purpose, but I can't really LUL
[00:47] <musty_badger> Are pistols actually useful? How many times do you actually swap to it when you need to reload?
[00:47] <savant7> @Cute_ but I painted my computer black in order to try and make it run faster and play basketball and rap, does that count Kappa
[00:47] <zervaldo> Curtsy don't you know that voice chat is the way for toxic players to bully people? Kappa
[00:47] <musty_badger> Or sawed off shotguns
[00:47] <mar45690> LUL
[00:47] <nikrado> i hope destiny plays mass effect after destiny
[00:47] <mar45690> No
[00:47] <nikrado> err after division
[00:47] <eh_polar_bear> there's no such thing as an ugly gun
[00:47] <nikrado> that would be a meme machine
[00:47] <cute_sc2> idk Musty_badgerwhat if you shot the person 249 times in the fact and it needs250 to die
[00:48] <zervaldo> are you sure Eh_polar_bear
[00:48] <cute_sc2> you might pull out your pistol
[00:48] <eh_polar_bear> I kinda wanna see Destiny play Mass Effect
[00:48] <eh_polar_bear> for the Wrex memes
[00:48] <zongopbongo> league of legions has no voice chat you stupid fuck Keepo
[00:48] <cute_sc2> face*
[00:48] <zongopbongo> hey, is that retard pacjax here?
[00:48] <eh_polar_bear> zervaldo, yes, all guns are beautiful
[00:48] <mar45690> No he is sleeping
[00:48] <curtsy> Destiny would most likely not even finish a single ME game
[00:48] <mar45690> Prob
[00:48] <eh_polar_bear> and you should feel bad for puttin gthem down
[00:48] <nikrado> i wanna see destiny be a space racist
[00:48] <nikrado> because you know he would be one
[00:48] <cute_sc2> What are you his fucking Dad @mar45690
[00:48] <atlaspearlogre> eh_polar_bear, no such thing as an ugly gun https://i.imgur.com/db7Nbk4.jpg

[00:49] <savant7> Rocket League has voice chat but you have to speak to enemy team at the same time, so everyone just uses the chat commands instead
[00:49] <savant7> unless they wanna be memers
[00:49] <eh_polar_bear> AtlasPearlOgre, precondition being a real gun that shoots real bullets and not rainbow farts
[00:49] <mar45690> @cute_sc2 I am just gussing since its past his bed time LUL
[00:49] <cute_sc2> Sounds like a very well designed system Savant7
[00:49] <eh_polar_bear> mar45690, no you mixed him up with pacjax
[00:49] <cute_sc2> That designer should be given many dollars
[00:49] <nikrado> @Savant7, thats not true there is a setting that makes it only to teamates
[00:49] <cute_sc2> and awards
[00:50] <cute_sc2> LUL Savant7 turns out you just have autism
[00:50] <cute_sc2> NICE MEME Nikrado

[00:51] <rlangdon13> ive been hard for about 3 and a half days now. really trying to live the dream
[00:51] <dvydvyv> Destiny I enjoyed your snack review

[00:51] <zervaldo> Eh_polar_bear i guess you're a stickler for perfection
[00:52] <savant7> someone spiked your food with viagra Keepo
[00:52] <mar45690> @eh_polar_bear let me guess you just like watching Koreans for LOL or SC 2 DansGame
[00:52] <eh_polar_bear> zervaldo, not really LUL but I feel like that game is best viewed played to perfection, kinda like CS
[00:52] <perfectskye> You were going to make the Hand Grip Destiny
[00:52] <eh_polar_bear> mar45690, you caught me LUL
