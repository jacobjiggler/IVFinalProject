This was because of the numerous rapes, assaults and some cases of overall threatening behavior. \n\nThis service may get the wind taken from its sails because of gender discrimination laws. \nWhat do you all think? \n\nThanks in advance! I'm interested in seeing the feedback and discussion. :)",

Right now I am using Google Apps Script. Its free and does a decent job but limits the number of REST calls my script can make. Since the script polls every second, it also hits the compute time threshold sometimes. The script should be running 24/7. The API I am polling does not have a pub/sub architecture. So polling is the only way to go. I am thinking of switching over to Amazon EC2 or OpenShift.",

Currently we are organizing 35 hackathons simultaniously during 25-29 May with 6 hackathons starting each 6 hours lasting 24h per hackathon. \n\nThis is of course a hectic period for me as an organizer especially because it is very hard to let you know all about the hackathons. Therefor I categorized them under http://nl.campus-party.org/challenges (check them out! All of them are global impact cases and we will supply hundreds of hackers with dev. Kits and thousands of IoT sensors and Arduinos to get you started)\n\nNext to that every hackathon has their own API's open which will result in an immense opportunity for developers to combine 10s of APIs to get to epic Innovative prototypes. Of course I am curious how to convince great hackers like you over to the event, is this enough excitement or what are things that really make you super interested and will even let you fly over :) \n\nWe currently have 200 Brazilians flying in 200 Spanish, 50 U.S.  and 100s from Germany, UK, Poland, Czech with a total of 2300 atm but we have space for 5000 tents so we are happy to give you an epic time here and a great way to come to Amsterdam for the first time perhaps ;)\n\nLet me know what you think, very curious if you have already heard from Campus Party.",

I feel it's important tool to have a grasp of this as it helps one understand their relative worth. \n\nI realize this is a subjective question which is why finding information about this online has been frustrating.  The data i've found is too often incomplete.  Either outdated, unspecific (base pay vs total comp?) or ambiguous in other ways.\n\nNaturally one of the reasons this is difficult to answer, is because this widely depends on where you work.  However, I would like you to narrow the scope of ambiguity in this case to what you would consider top tier companies. \n\nSo if you could please, let me know your input! How much do you / or your \"friends\" make?  Also explain your answer, for example which city are you referring to? How much is base vs equity?  \n\nAlso if you have input to make the question more intelligible, please do!",

What the app does is that it shows data about the location on mouse hover. For example, If the user hovers over Los Angeles it outlines the city borders and shows population, average property value etc. \n\nWhat we have learned so far is that we can use JavaScript, AJAX and MySQL database for all this, and Python as our back-end.\nThe problem is we are not sure how to fetch data from the SQL server and also how all this is connected. Are there any good tutorials on how to do something like this? W3C tutorials are very basic and don't show the big picture.\n\nThank you for all the help.\n\nP.S We are able to show static data on the map using JavaScript.",

He can build much quicker using PHP and mysql, but now we are mixing technologies and might need to build things that have already been built if we just stick to one stack.\nWhat do you guys/girls think?\nI've read article on the pro's and con's of both. I'd love to know your input or experiences, thanks!",

It's always easy to go from industry to teaching. How hard the other way ?

But both places are not especially known for good work-life balance cultures. You know how it goes - hippie coders proud of their 12-14 hour work day, sprinting like Usain Bolt towards burnout. But the work scope at both the places is huge, cutting edge, evolving tech - working with Android OS modifications (something I have been doing via OSS contribs for last 4 years. \nI also have an offer to take up a teaching job at a highly successful and profitable code school. It'll also be like a first 1~5 employee level hire, where I'll be also responsible for near future expansion plans (There is huge demand, wait lists of 400-500 students, so there is great scope of expanding business).

Accelerators exist for hackers who want to turn their idea into a fundable startup, but what about the ones who just go to a hackathon to try out programming? Many beginners attend hackathons to get a taste of CS. While they're a good place to start, many are probably (disclaimer: don't have actual info on this, just presuming) lost on how to continue after the event, and end up back at square one.\n\nSo in addition to retaining rookie hackathon attendees, projects would also be maintained and improved upon. More coders, better software, greater long-term usefulness of hackathons -- win-win-win situation, right?\n\nThoughts on this idea?",

I'm wondering if anyone here has GPGPU programming experience and is willing to share some tips and tricks. \n\nI'm studying physics, math, and CS right now, and I'll be the head of a project in our atomic physics lab that is essentially concerned with building an AI framework for automating all of the lasers and other fancy lab hardware. I'm  more or less up to date on the machine learning and whatnot that I'll need for the adaptive modules and I have some help from my math department associates for the computer vision components, but we have a major challenge in that all of our fancy AI code needs to run *fast* on a pitifully small workstation hardware budget. \n\nI'll be building the system that all of this is running on, and the current plan is to max our single precision FLOPS and memory bandwith, then see how far we can get with running most of our math on the GPUs. This gets us to territory that's unfamiliar to me, at least for the most part. I'll be studying up on the available APIs (we'll probably be using AMD hardware because you can't beat their price per FLOP and their last gen cards still have respectable memory bandwith) but I figured I might as well ask around and see if anyone can point me in a productive direction right off the bat. \n\nI'm super stoked about this project and we have tons of time to get everything done, so this is more of a \"looking for friendly advice\" request than a \"holy balls my deadline was yesterday pls halp\" post. Thanks in advance for any comments (and feel free to ask about the project if I've somehow intrigued you) n.n",

Since the hackathon, we’ve made many improvements and still have a lot of new ideas to keep iterating - for instance making it an educational experience for those who are new to guitar.",

Both the MBP keyboard and my wireless keyboard. No escape key registered. How do I figure out what is hijacking the keypresses so I can freakin' exit insert mode in vim and save my work?\n\nedit - Ayush Jain ponited out that ctrl + [ functions similarly to escape in vim, which solves my immediate issue. However, I can't even map a hotkey to esc. Whatever is hijacking my escapes even hijacks the hotkey. \n\nAny advice on how to proceed without having to wipe my OS would be GREATLY appreciated.",

That's something I was taught a lot about in my first programming class at UMich, Gaming for the Greater Good. We made computer games that somehow had to try to help rehabilitate kids with autism. We learned next to 0 programming in class, but spent a lot of time learning about autism. \n\nI applaud these guys for their work. It's really cool, truly. But I think this is a cool instance of being able to point out how important it is to think of how your creation is actually gonig to be used, how it fits into your user's life, and, very importantly, why you need someone on your team with very in depth knowledge of the problem you are trying to solve / industry you are tackling. \n\nIn the end, this is a good example of cool engineering from talented people, with a disconnect between them and the purpose of their product.",

Anyway, I just stayed at this amazing mental hospital called St. Helena's for bipolar disorder and apparently they can accept shirts with brand names on them (which homeless shelters cannot). Hospitals like these desperately need clothing, so I'm thinking of doing this huge donation haul of tech shirts/any other clothing you don't want any more. Specifically, underwear is something they desperately need. \n\nPlease message/comment if you would like to help with this cause!\n\nDetails: \n\nSt. Helena's Hospital Center For Behavioral Health\n\nAddress: \n525 Oregon Street\nVallejo, CA 94590\n\nYou can just put everything in a box and mail it to them using the address above. I would also include a little note saying how these are donations (from ______). For those of you on the east coast, I *highly* recommend contacting mental hospitals in the area so you won't have to pay expensive shipping. \n\nAlso, I plan on writing an iOS app revolving around mental health (WebMD for disorders, pill notifications, disorder information, treatment options, hospital ratings, etc). Let me know if you would like to help!",

So I have created a custom object in JavaScript and included the custom object type in my background scripts for the extension. I am running into issues once an object with the type of group (my custom object) is saved into storage. Chrome.storage.sync.set serializes objects of type object down to {} which is object literals so when I am pulling that object out of storage later, the methods that I added to the prototype are throwing errors that the methods don't exist. I tried moving the methods inside the functions in an object literal format and it didn't seem to make a difference. Can anyone help!? If you want to look at the code click the link below, the error is thrown on line 69 after using the popup to add a url. After clicking the button it is receiving the message, and then tries to check whether the group contains the url and that is where the isssues begin! Thanks in advance guys",

Learning how to make a Chrome extension has helped me solidify some of my web development skills and I really enjoyed making it.

I just published my first Chrome extension and I could really use some feedback and suggestions from you guys! I know it is pretty basic and simple right now but there are many features planned for the future!\n\nCurrently the extension allows you to save urls and have them open when you start chrome up, I am currently working on features to allow you to assign urls to a group and open groups of urls at start up or while you are using Chrome. I know I get tired of opening the same tabs over and over when I am doing thing like working on school work or gaming. This extension is the solution to that problem! \n\nAgain would love some feedback and maybe a rating on the webstore  :) thanks so much guys!",

Obviously this is all just a bunch of information floating around, but I was hoping if anyone here had some insight that could help me get a clearer understanding of the schools, then I'd really really appreciate it. \nThank you!",

I am looking for a co-founder (maybe two?) to help finish the product. I want to move to more of a business focus on the app and need some technical help to get everything finished. I've already figured out the stack (but I am open to recommendations). Technology is React, Plivo, and Node. The product is a conversation app that aggregates data for team managers to see how their team is doing. If you are interested in working on something like this, shoot me a message! I'd love to grab coffee and chat! You can check out the product landing page here: ",

I did the opposite, starting with C++ and then moving to Java and in about a million different directions afterwards, picking up a few languages pretty quickly. I think that going from C++ as a starting point was super beneficial for me, not least because many other languages have their syntax, etc. derived from it, but also because it required *so* much legwork that a lot of other languages abstract away -- understanding what was going on behind the scenes when I use Python, for example, or even Java (what with the garbage collection and memory management) has made me a better programmer. I'm trying to petition my university to drop Python and JS as the entry level languages (most people don't see Java until sophomore year) and something a little lower-level. I have found through helping some of my classmates that a lot of their issues and bugs come from not handling correctly the things that the high-level languages abstracted away.

It's a programming competition that will last over 8 days. \n\nThe aim will be to program an autonomous bot and send it fight into an arena against other players' bots. \n\n25 programming languages are available to code a solution, and it takes less than 10 minutes to come up with a basic AI.\n\nWe're pretty much excited about the game (hint: Puyo Puyo). We've tried to make it both fun and beautiful in terms of animations.\n\nHere's the link to register: https://goo.gl/XKgK3Z\n\nSignup is free for everyone and there will be cool prizes to win (HTC Vive Headset, Myo armband, Geekbox).\n\nIf you want to practice a little bit and check what the environment looks like, we advise you to start with 2 solo puzzles:\n- \"Surface\": https://goo.gl/7dZOyt\n- \"Gravity\": https://goo.gl/VqTgEU\n\nThanks for checking!",

For anyone else who had to tear their hair out about this: Change the map div with form 40% to whatever else (I just took it out entirely to get 100%), then force reload js.js (not map.js which I was trying to do) which will cause the map to reload.",

I am making a payment request from my mobile (more than once), but the backend should only execute only one. Once the request is executed its status is marked as COMPLETED.
