The main purpose of this event is to introduce makers and hackers to the entrepreneurial community and provide avenues for creating startups through interdisciplinary collaboration. We are connecting the teams formed in the event with mentors and other entrepreneurship communities like #yesphx (Startup Week) which will help guide their project to the next level.\nSome details about the event:\n \nDate & Time:   4:30p April 22nd – 6:30p 24th\nLocation:          Startup Labs, ASU Polytechnic campus",

However, these labs allow for the advanced variation in our academic programs, such as Computer Forensics and other cyber security courses, Capstone Projects, Networking, Robotics, and Big Data and HPC related research.\n \nRight now, students in the department have been mobilized to protest this decision and we have gained some traction. We are now looking outside the university community to get more support for our cause. I have attached a link to our petition that I hope you will consider looking over, signing, and passing on to your students and colleagues. As students, we do not want this change to occur and we imagine that a change like this would set a precedent for other universities to scale back their computer science and information technology departments.\n\nThese changes will affect our student experience. You should be concerned that a building that was built and dedicated as the \"Institute of Advanced Applied Science and Higher Technology\" is being gutted in favor of other unrelated academic departments and administrative functions. Beyond this, you should be concerned that these changes do not meet the strategic academic needs of students in this technological era.\n\nI hope you find the time to look it over, sign it, and pass it on!\n\n",

However, SQL usage (both raw and with ORMs) with Node have significantly less documentation and community backing. Why do very few people (at least on tutorials, public projects) use Node.js with SQL or ORMs in comparison to those who uses NoSQL?\n\nAll I see for Node.js is the MEAN stack and various NoSQL set ups (bundled in things like meteor). It's very strange for me to see so little content and a very small community working on Node and SQL. Although ORMs have performance drawbacks, I also hear a lot of drawbacks of using non-relational databases (like startups failing, etc) as opposed to SQL's reliability and age, plus ORMs solve the Object-Impedence mismatch issue.\n\nI had to use SQL on a Node project and to cope with this, I used the most popular Node ORM Sequelize to map my JavaScript code to SQL queries so that I could focus on using one language, but the documentation and community is lacking and as a result it took a lot of time for me to discover how to use it in simple ways that would take me minutes on MongoDB.  \n\nDo you think sequelize or other ORMS are mature enough for production environments? Is there a lot of overhead with ORMs like Sequelize + Node?﻿",

Maths is all about manipulating objects which follow some set of rules. As I explain in the proposal, this is pretty much one of the definitions of a game. Thus VR will improve the experience of maths for the exact same reasons it is improving the experience in games\n\nAlso, we will not just improve how we do maths\nwe will qualitatively change how we do maths\n\nI mean, computers have already made some parts of maths incredibly better, and these will of course keep improving with VR. These are things like geometry, and a few other visualization programs.\n\nHowever, these are kinda the obvious things for which you'd do maths in a game-like fashion.\n\nThe novel idea of AugMath is that the more algebraic part, the more formal part, the part of maths that seems to be more about the \"left brain\", and thus often more boring to people, can actually be as interesting, visually appealing, and awesome to explore, as the other parts\n\nPeople that play with cellular automata have already seen this, but this is a bit of an obscure part of maths, compared to algebra, calculus, etc. But all of these can also be upgraded with the helps of computers, and VR.\n\nThis is all about a shift from putting maths in a pedestal of abstraction where mathematicians find it so beautiful and elegant, but in reality they have lost all clarity that could make people understand, and going instead to the more pragmatic idea of concrete maths. Instead of some proffesor telling you x should do this and that, and you are supposed to fit all this in your head, and whatever. You see x, you poke it, and it does the right thing. It is maths that does what it should, from the beginning. It will also be maths that looks like what it means. 5 doesn't doesn't look like the number 5. IIIII, does. That is the power of good notation (in an extremelly simplified case here lol)\"\n\nMore detailed description: https://www.overleaf.com/read/vrghkvfndjzb\n\nEarly history: https://forum.fractalfuture.net/t/augmented-math-and-education/265",

The question I'm asking of this group today is this: are we not better than this? \n\nThe hacker movement began many decades before most of us got involved. It was grounded in a community that saw itself as enabling human empowerment through personal technology. It was about freeing ourselves to be whatever we wanted to be. The nascent PC industry, with deep roots into the 60's counterculture movement, saw these tools as empowering human connection and human freedom.\n\nHave you ever stopped and thought about what TCP/IP as a protocol really means? It means you don't need centralization to communicate. It means you don't need anybody to tell you who you can and can't talk with. It means you can connect these devices and suddenly you can talk and work on projects with anyone around the world. And it means that there's nothing technically anyone can do to stop you. Unix, TCP/IP, the world wide web, etc -- these tools that we take for-granted were utopic - even communistic -- visions about giving power to communities. This group is an example of one kind of community that's enabled through this amazing technical medium. There's been a lot of corruption in the process, sure. Maybe corporatism is to blame for all of our problems. I don't know. What I do know is that each and every day each of us can try and be a just a bit better.\n\nHistorically, hackathons -- real hackathons, not corporate megahackathons -- are about bringing people together in that spirit of empowerment through community. But in a community, nobody attempts to appear as if they are better, smarter, or cooler than anyone else. Communities share, communities give, communities love. People in communities act together towards shared vision and values. They don't pat themselves on the chest, and they certainly don't insult one another.  \n\nAm I perfect at living out community ideals? No, I'm just as bad as the next guy. When someone \"likes\" one of my Facebook posts, I feel a short, euphoric, even addicting sense of excitement. I probably will feel that feeling for rush for everyone who \"likes\" and comments on this post. It's something I'm working on. It's probably why I talk a lot about myself. I am not perfect. But I'm trying. \n\nThis group is giant. It's bigger than any of our friends from computing's past could've ever imagined. But it's only as powerful as the love each of us brings to the table.\n\nAre we here to criticize others? Are we here to shitpost /r/programmerhumor for maximum likes and comments? Are we here to make our Medium posts go #viral? Or are we here to grow together? To build together? To love together?\n\nI think we're here for the latter reasons, and I think we can do better. \n\nThere are many wonderful people who have already resigned from believing that we can do better -- even calling this space \"cancer.\" Hell, Cirque du Twerque, an entire community of people upset at what HH has become has developed outside of it purely to ridicule it, and I'm admittedly a key part of that community. I think these people are actually signs that we can do better -- that we need to do better. \n\nSo I'm writing this post out of desperation -- to call on each one of you to bring your love to the table. To try and be just a bit better every day. To post things because they are interesting, not because they will make you popular. \n\nWe will never all agree. But we can disagree in ways which make us all better. We can engage in rational, loving debate -- debate that's about thinking about the kind of world we can be building, not how horrible we think the world is today. We don't need to yell at key members of our community over language on a piece of paper, and we don't need to insult our fellow human beings because we think we're smarter than them.\n\nThere are certain things, of course, the mod team -- if we wanted them to -- could do to make this a more loving space. Banning memes, for instance, which are rooted in virality and which are designed specifically to overshadow other dialogue -- would be a huge step in the right direction. \n\nBut we don't need them to take action. We could simply decide that we don't want memes in this group, and not post them. We could decide as a community that we want to come together in this virtual space to become better hackers and builders. \n\nAnd that's what I'm asking from this group one last time. Can we each decide that we want to love each other a little bit more? I think we can. \n\nAnd I think a good way to start that -- if you've made it this far -- is to comment on this post with someone who went out their way to help you (at a hackathon, through this group, or elsewhere) and how that changed your life.\n\n<3",

OS X was running first obviously, then came Ubuntu around a year ago, and Windows got in just a few months back. Everything was quite fine until a few weeks ago when I thought it might be not the worst idea to apt-get update & upgrade Ubuntu, since it wanted me to update every time it started. Since then my refind boot menu doesn't show my Windows system anymore. It still recognizes the Windows NTFS partition but boots into Ubuntu when I select it. \nI installed Windows by creating a boot DVD and replacing my second HDD with the super drive my MacBook came with, but after that I changed back to the second HDD for obvious reasons. So now my question: what actually might be broken? How can I fix the issue? And is there a way to repair my Windows boot partition without reinstalling Win10 completely? As this particular setup is rather rare I didn't find a valuable solution online yet.\nThanks in advance for your thoughts/help/solutions! \nGreets from Germany 🖖",

I don't have a technical background (my boss does!) but I do aim for the best experience for my event visitors. So I joined this group to learn and understand. One question is puzzling me; what makes a hackathon challenge intriguing? My boss say data sets. I also saw Kaggle competitions with 30000$ prizes. One hacker I spoke with likes 'good' data, like hacking for the Red Cross, another just loves the ambiance of working with others and compete.

And why? What works and doesn't work?\n\nWhat are the best ways to on-board users into an app that's introducing some quite novel concepts?\n\nWe considered 3 approaches:\n\n1. TOUR. Have some sort of \"tour\" at the start that describes the main concepts\n2. HINTS. Provide hints / tooltips to guide the user through the app in-context as they use it, starting with the most basic thing they should do, and progressively disclosing\n3. NOTHING. Just make it as simple and obvious as possible what to do and people can discover how it works.\n\nWe've been through a few iterations of our on-boarding experience and we're still struggling with users \"getting it\". Striving for (3) and felt the need to do some (1).\n\nhexapp allows anyone to read and write messages and media into objects or places in the real-world, identified by QR code, barcode, NFC tag or GPS location.\n\nI'm very interested in:\na. Are the first few intro screens in the app an effective way of introducing the main concepts of the app?\nb. Is it clear what to do once you get through those intro screens?\nc. How do the on-boarding screens make you feel about the app?\n\nOpen to and ready for constructive criticism and this is newly open to the public so if you find any bugs would love to know!\n\nThanks!",

Being a B corporation seems to say absolutely nothing about how the company runs, it's just a certification that says, \"We've filled out a form that says that we care about some other purpose despite being for-profit.\"  All it takes to become a B corporation is to add the following language to your Articles of Incorporation:\n\n\"In discharging his or her duties, and in determining what is in the best interests of the corporation (the \"Company\") a Director shall not be required to regard any interest, or the interests of any particular group affected by such action, as a dominant or controlling interest or factor.\n\nHe or she shall give due consideration to the following factors, including, but not limited to, the long-term prospects and interests of the Company and its shareholders, and the social, economic, legal, or other effects of any action on the current and retired employees, the suppliers and customers of the Company or its subsidiaries, and the communities and society in which the Company or its subsidiaries operate, (collectively, with the shareholders, the \"Stakeholders\" ), together with the short-term, as well as long-term, interests of its shareholders and the effect of the Company's operations (and its subsidiaries' operations) on the environment and the economy of the state, the region and the nation.\n\nNothing in this Article express or implied, is intended to create or shall create or grant any right in or for any person other than a shareholder or any cause of action by or for any person other than a shareholder.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, any Director is entitled to rely upon the definition of \"best interests\" as set forth above in enforcing his or her rights hereunder, and under state law and such reliance shall not, absent another breach, be construed as a breach of a Director's fiduciary duty of care, even in the context of a Change in Control Transaction where, as a result of weighing other Stakeholders' interests, a Director determines to accept an offer, between two competing offers, with a lower price per share.\"\n\nThe only thing that is guaranteed by this is that the Director has free reign. There's no enforcement policy for wrongdoing, there's no guarantees, absolutely nothing regarding preservation of hacker principles etc. I'd love to see the MLH Articles myself to determine whether or not this is the case, but I bet Swift (acting as a representative of MLH- nothing personal!) has some canned excuse as to why that can't be done. Google isn't being very kind either, and to obtain a copy myself costs $5 and must be done through the mail. (http://www.dos.ny.gov/corps/faq_copies.page.asp)\n\nI'm still wholly unconvinced that there's no self-interest at play within MLH, and that's why I'm concerned about conflict of interests between MLH and HH. MLH undoubtedly has the end goal of seeking profit, and a profit motive creates funny incentive schema that often work against customers (the hacking public.)\n\n",

After we shut down our social video streaming app in January of this year, we had so much awesome tech left over, but not the money to support it. We've now made the entire thing open source so that all of you can build your own social apps. With a little bit of tweaking, this API is capable of pretty much anything a social network needs. You will no longer need to build your own backend, and it's fully documented. You could technically build your own version of Netflix, Facebook, or Twitter with it. It even has support for things like notifications, it has a full CI testing, and has been used in production in our products.\n\nYou can get it at https://github.com/Whitespell/whitespell-api (Please leave a star if you like what we've built).\n\nHere's what we built with it:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwsMM5hElkXESW0xMHFvMG9Ic1U/view\n\nDocumentation: http://whitespell.github.io/slate/\n\nIf you love something, set it free!

What is the proper way to market an app? \n2. Best way to engage customers?(Twitter, fb, etc)\n3. How much of your day would you spend engaging customers?\n4. Would it make sense to pay for Twitter/fb ads if the app is free or $0.99?\n5. How do you get an app onto major websites like Product Hunt, Tech Crunch, etc?\n6. Other than an app, what else is needed to really give an app the best chance of succeeding? (Website, social media pages, email handle, etc) \n\nLet me explain where I'm at. I've developed many apps for both personal and freelance, but that's where my skill set ends when it comes to apps. There has always been another person to do marketing, so I want to know what it takes to become the whole package. \n\nOf course it would be dumb for me to ask these questions without having an app…so I developed Hole Keeper, a small app to keep track of score for games like corn hole, washers, etc. Whatever advice I get from this post I'm going to apply it to Hole Keeper. I'm not looking at it as a $1 million app, but as an app I can use to help improve my marketing skills. \n\nWhat has been completed:\n1. Developed and submitted to App Store(Pending Developer Release)\n2. Created website with fully functional beta tester form.(http://www.holekeeper.com/)\n3. Twitter account \n\nWhat else needs to be on the “Completed list” before releasing? Whatever advice you can give would greatly be appreciated. \n\nThanks!",

My best friend and I are creating a geolocation mobile application that enables its users to find spaces (bars, restaurants, hostels, etc.) near them based on their taste in music, how much money they can spend, the mood they are looking for (date or drinking your pants off or talk with friends) and the distance.\n\nBasically it is the love child of a three sum among Tinder, Yelp and Airbnb with my own Central American touch in the mix. We name this child @Vynil\n\nIt is meant for all of us that visit a new city and don´t know where to go in real time. Of course we can research but after an event everybody wants to go for drinks and you end up in the nearest pub or whatever...there is more fun out there.\n\nRight now we applied to Start-Up Chile with our idea and the most BASIC MVP ever, we are relaunching in May with this site http://govynil.com/ and our Android/IOS App.\n\nNow the question,\n\nI would love that you guys destroy my idea, give me mercyless feedback and if you like the idea add yourself to this group in which Im doing a collage of all the places around the world that buddies of mine and likeminded entrepreneurs hang out.\n\nI want to stick together to create a collaborative ad for Vynil, proper credits will be given to everyone and you will get to see cool places from around the world!

I've seen a few other services out there, but they all charge at least $100/month.\n\nJust seed it with a few twitter users whose followers you want to follow you. Then the bot will follow them (with the intention that they'll follow back). If they don't follow back in 30 days, the bot will unfollow them.\n\nThis one is free to run on Heroku! (Check out the readme for setup instructions.)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions. Forking is not only welcome, but encouraged.\n\nhttps://github.com/lambtron/coopboost\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/k4rjkrW.gif",

I think it's just about ready for more people to start trying it out, so I’m excited to invite all of you to start trying it out!\n\nhttp://facebook.com/twozeroo18\n\nMessage it with “@2018 help” for a somewhat detailed guide on what it can do, and how to use the bot.\n\nIt can do things like:\n- changing the chat color to any hex color\n- changing the chat emoji to any unicode emoji!\n- looking things up for when you're too lazy to google\n- having a conversation with when you're lonely with no friends\n- ... and more!\n\nPlease note that this is like an alpha version, and that many things aren’t working as expected.  It’s currently not based on the new APIs — it’s using a much more “hacky” solution that essentially involves simulating logging into messenger.com and sending messages as a person — so it won’t work perfectly.  (sometimes, it'll miss a message -- just resend it and it should work fine!)\n\nOver the next couple of months, I’ll continue releasing updates with more features (including /giphy — slack users rejoice) please feel free to keep using the bot!  It can hopefully do a lot for you.  The more you use it, the more it’ll learn about human interaction — the AI learns from conversations, so the more people chat with it, the smarter it becomes!\n\nand of course, if you see any bugs or have any questions/comments/concerns, please message me and lmk so I can fix it :)\n\nthanks, and I hope this experiment turns out amazing <3",

Think of it like a way to keep a file on people, but of course only to be used for good (like presents they'll enjoy!). I'm pretty new to programming generally (I'm more of a clever dude who can copy and paste lol) so I'm humbly wondering (now that I have a project!) what programming language I should learn to get the most out of my database idea.

Every \"problem\" about Flash could have been fixed, instead we are stuck with Javascript + HTML5 that has problems that cannot be fundamentally fixed. I mean, consider the following:\n\n1. Flash is truly write once run everywhere.\nFlash runs on the plugin, every single browser that supported it has the same experience. Could you say the same about HTML5 and Javascript? Not every browser supports the same HTML5 feature set, in a sense we're going back to the bad old Netscape vs IE days with browser specific prefixes.\n\n2. Flash is compiled, giving developers slightly better IP protection\nJavascript is interpreted, anyone can examine your source code and steal your hard work. Flash is compiled, and although it isn't too much harder to decompile flash (since it compiles to byte code), flash obfuscators work a lot better than javascript obfuscators.\n\n3. Flash has the potential to be a lot faster than javascript.\nSince Flash is compiled to byte code like Java and .net, it has the potential to be a lot faster than an interpreted environment like Javascript. In fact, good 'semi compiled' platforms like .net can approach native code in speed, something that no interpreted language can do. Although Flash did perform poorly in most of its life, a bit of work and investment can easily fix that.\n\n4. Flash's security issues were overblown.\nTo say that Flash is bad because it is insecure is ignoring the hundreds of thousands of browser bugs that pop up on every browser, are you telling me that Javascript engines don't have exploits? The perception of flash's security problems actually IMO comes from the time when browsers only displayed simple HTML and Javascript, all the other features were handled by flash. As browser complexity goes up due to rendering engines and javascript engines being forced to handle increasingly larger feature sets, there is a very good chance that we will see more exploits targeting rendering engines and javascript engines. Also, flash's security problems is honestly nothing more developmental effort and investment couldn't fix. \n\ntl;dr: every one of Flash's major issues could have probably been fixed. Fragmentation, performance, and certain other issues with HTML5 + javascript is impossible to fix",

Of vind je het leuk om hier met andere studenten over na te denken? Dan mag jij tijdens de EduChallenge niet ontbreken!\nVan 20 t/m 22 april vindt de EduChallenge op het Science Park in Utrecht plaats.  De studentenwedstrijd is bedoeld voor HBO en WO studenten uit heel Nederland. Op de eerste dag worden de teams samengesteld en kiest ieder team één innovatief idee om mee aan de slag te gaan. Dit idee wordt in de twee daarop volgende dagen, met begeleiding van coaches en experts uit het werkveld, omgezet in een concept of prototype. Ieder team sluit de EduChallenge af met een pitch van het eindresultaat, waarna een jury de winnaar bekend maakt. Iedere deelnemer uit het winnende team ontvangt een prachtig prijzenpakket twv. €500,-.\n\nLijkt het jou leuk om mee te doen aan deze wedstrijd? Ga dan naar www.educhallenge.nl en meld je aan!

Launched in 2014 by US Secretary of State John Kerry at the Our Ocean conference, Fishackathon 2016 will be held in over 40 cities around the world.\n\nhttp://fishackathon.hackitarians.com/ \n\nFishackathon is a wonderful example of how we can use technology to address some of the world’s most challenging issues. As an animal lover, ocean enthusiast, member of the OceanElders and supporter of Ocean Unite, I’m passionate about protecting the ocean and its species, and am looking forward to seeing what wonderful innovations the Fishackathon spurs. I encourage all coders and fish fans, or anyone else who’s interested, to participate in this event, says Richard Branson, founder of Virgin.com.\n\nThe event is free to attend, all food and drinks will be supplied, and Fishackers are welcome to work late into the evenings and grab sleep at the venue.\n\nAfter working hard on the weekend the groups will be able to present their work to an expert panel of judges who will then evaluate the teams’ presentations and groups that most effectively develop usable solutions to the problem of global overfishing and will be rewarded with prizes including €10,000 cash and €25,000 in development support. Besides the cash prizes, organisers will throw in some local ‘money can’t buy’ prizes.\n\nOrganisers are looking for (game/UI/UX) designers, (game/app/full-stack) developers, coders, computer/data scientists, subject matter experts (Oceanography, Fish Science) and others who believe they have the skills to tackle this challenge of worldwide overfishing. Potential sponsors are welcome to contact the Hackitarians if they are interested in getting involved.\n\nPlease apply for the Fishackathon here for your chance to make a difference and win!\n\nhttp://fishackathon.hackitarians.com/\n\nThe event is supported by, U.S. Department of State, U.S. Embassy The Hague, European Space Agency (ESA), Liquid Robotics, Dutch Game Garden, Dutch Games Association, Wageningen University and organised by Dutch Hackathon Foundation, Stichting Hackitarians.\n\nAttendees should bring bedding (pillow, blanket) if they want to spend the nights at the venue. Or can take ferry back to the mainland in the evenings and return in the mornings to stay on mainland hotel or return home if they so choose (not covered by organisers).\n\nFort Island IJmuiden is a semi-underground fortress that is situated at the estuary of the North Sea Canal. The Fort Island was created around 1885 as an important advanced defence post for the gateway to Amsterdam. Some of its most interesting features include an impressive dining hall, a dungeon and an armoury. In 2012, the attraction was awarded the Golden Green Key, becoming the first UNESCO World Heritage location to obtain a golden environmental label.\nThe island is well served by deploying two vessels,  the ‘Fortwachter’ and the ‘Koningin Emma’.. The crossing to the island is a flight of about 10 minutes.",
